  <p>Brandock the Mage is an NPC Mod for the whole Baldur's Gate Series. It is natively compatible with BG:EE, SoD, BGII, BGT, BGII:EE, EET. No Tutu.<br /> Please note: So far, the mod officially contains BG1 content only. Brandock should already be fully functional in SoD with reactions to most game events, can be met and join the group in BGII, reacts to the mage stronghold and sphere quest, and has an epilogue, but apart from that content for SoD and BGII is not done yet.

<h1><a name="install" id="install">Installation</a></h1>
<div class="section">

NOTE: If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting a new version. To do this, uninstall all previously installed components and delete the mod folder and executables. 
<br />
Make sure the game is not running while installing the mod.<br />
When installing or uninstalling, do not close the DOS window by clicking on the X button! Instead, press the Enter key when instructed to do so.<br />

<h2> <a name="eegames" id="quest">Notes to modding EE games</a></h2>
If you use SoD from GOG or Steam, you need to prepare your game with DLC Merger or modmerge before installing any mods:<br />
<a href="https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/71305/mod-dlc-merger-merge-steam-gog-sod-dlc-or-custom-dlcs-with-the-main-game">argent77's DLC Merger</a><br />
<a href="https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/50441/modmerge-merge-your-steam-gog-zip-based-dlc-into-something-weidu-nearinfinity-dltcep-can-use/p1">modmerge</a>(if in doubt, use the DLC Merger instead)<br />
For Enhanced Edition it is important that you istall the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.
<br />
The EE games are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. 
<h2> <a name="windows" id="quest">Windows</a></h2>
Extract the contents of the mod archive to your game's main directory (BG:EE/SOD/BG2/BGT/BGII:EE/EET which contains the CHITIN.KEY file). On successful extraction, there should be an c#brandock folder and a setup-c#brandock.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click setup-c#brandock.exe and follow the instructions on screen.<br />
Run setup-c#brandock.exe in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.<br />
<h2> <a name="osx" id="quest">macOS</a></h2>
Extract the mod archive, then copy the contents of the folder into your game folder (BG:EE/SOD/BG2/BGT/BGII:EE/EET which contains the CHITIN.KEY file). If properly extracted, you should have a "c#brandock" folder, setup-c#brandock, and setup-c#brandock.command in your game folder. To install, simply double-click setup-c#brandock.command and follow the instructions on screen.<br />
Run setup-c#brandock.command in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.<br />
<h2> <a name="linux" id="quest">Linux</a></h2>
Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify. Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal and cd to your BG2 installation directory, run 'tolower' and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.<br />
Run WeInstall c#brandock in your game folder to install the mod. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing. <br />

<h1><a name="compat" id="compat">Compatibility with other mods and Install Order</a></h1>
<div class="section">
Brandock the Mage was implemented with WeiDU with highest priority to compatibility with other mods.<br />
The mod is compatible with Imoen 4 Ever.<br />
The mod is compatible with Endless BG1.<br />
As an NPC mod, this mod should be installed after quest mods and before tweak mods. There is crossmod content included in the mod which should show if the install order suggestions are being followed.<br />
To see most cross mod content, install the mod in the following order (other mods listed in alphabetical order!):<br />
(at least the Crossmod component:) AFTER: Alternatives, BGQE, BG1NPC, Brage's Redemption, EndlessBG1, Gavin BG1, Imoen4Ever, NPC Strongholds, Solaufein's Rescue, The Calling, Transitions, Valerie NPC.<br /> 
(main Brandock component:) BEFORE: Grey the Dog.<br />
Crossmod with aTweaks "Allow Mages to scribe memorized spells onto scrolls": for aTweaks component "Allow Mages to scribe memorized spells onto scrolls" there is an own compatibility component in the Brandock mod with two options. Option 1 will disable the aTweaks scribe scroll ability completely. Option 2 will integrate the aTweaks option into Brandock's original scroll scribing ablity. This means the following: with option 2, Brandock will only gain the ability like in his original quest, not necessarily at level 9, and he will only be able to write one scroll per day. Do not install the compatibility component to have the original aTweaks ability alongside Brandock's own scribe scroll ability.<br />

</div>

<h1><a name="content" id="content">Description</a></h1>
<div class="section">
<h2> <a name="generalcontent" id="generalcontent">General Info</a></h2>
Brandock is a mage NPC for Baldur's Gate. He is curious, friendly and helpful, but it will take a little time until he opens up and tells the PC where he originates from, for reasons he will readily explain once he is ready to.<br />

<h2> <a name="where" id="where">Where to meet in Game</a></h2>
In BG1 Brandock will wait at the Coast Way in the north. He needs help to fight an Ogre who is camping in front of a cave where Brandock needs to go in and retrieve some of his possessions. The Ogre can also be killed without Brandock in party but he will only recognize it after joining. The Ogre is the one that has Unshey's girdle.<br />
In SoD, Brandock will be in front of the Ducal Palace, waiting in the crowd.<br />
In BGII he can be found in a small house right in the north west besides the sphere in the slums.<br />

<h2> <a name="content" id="content">Content</a></h2>
Brandock comes with friendship talks, own quests, and banters with some NPCs, and player initiated dialogues. The latter offers the possibility to ask Brandock a lot of questions to topics he mentioned or events in game. While travelling with Brandock, the PC learns about why he is at the Sword Coast and where he is from - both deeply connected to well known locations of the BG games but I do not want to spoiler too much. Brandock talks a lot, and there will be several topics along the game's story that will keep his thoughts - and mouth - busy.<br />
<br />

<h2> <a name="stats" id="stats">Brandock's Stats and Portrait</a></h2>
When first met in BG1, he will be a second level mage with the spells Armor, Burning Hands, Charm Person, Protection from Petrification, Identify, Magic Missile, Chromatic Orb, Resist Fear, Mirror Image, and Sleep in his spell book.<br />
When starting a new SoD or BGII game, he receives correspondingly more experience points and has more spells in his spellbook. Also his equipment (cloak, staff, sling) is more powerful when starting in SoD or BGII.<br />
 Brandock will level up upon first joining in BG1, SoD, SoA, and ToB when the PC's HP are higher than his. Also every time Brandock's XP are lower than the PC's when rejoining the group after being 7th Party Member.<br /><br />
Brandock's alignment is Chaotic Good.<br /><br />
His stats are the following:
      <ul> 
		<li>STR: 15</li>
		<li>DEX: 13</li>
		<li>CON: 13</li>
		<li>INT: 18</li>
		<li>WIS: 12</li>
		<li>CHA: 13</li>
      </ul> <br />
Brandock starts with an increased Lore base score of 10 due to story reasons.<br />
For the English version, Brandock's soundset was spoken by BignatiousMacIntosh.<br /><br />
Brandock's portraits were generously created and provided by Acifer. There are four portraits to chose from in an optional component:<br /><br />

<img src="readme/brandA2.png">
<img src="readme/brandA3.png"><br />
Insecure (Default portrait) ----- Friendly (Alternate 1) ----- Mischevious (Alternate 2) ----- Juvenile (Alternate 3)

<h2> <a name="spoiler" id="spoiler">Walkthrough / Spoilers</a></h2>	
Finding Brandock's possessions will start a cycle of dialogues and after that his quest. Retrieving his possessions as early as possible will make sure the quest will start before going to Candlekeep, which gives more content. <br />
<br />
Having Brandock in party when bringing Melicamp to Thalantyr will trigger an event which will remove Brandock from the party until Melicamp is restored. This event is interesting for Brandock's personal development, but the mod can also played without it. The event can be prevented by forbitting Brandock to help Melicamp with a spell.<br />
<br />
Brandock is very interested in magic books and wisdom. He will ask for time to study magic books and go through many of the libraries found in game. If granted, this will give him a bonus to his lore score until he is too experienced (in BGII).<br />


<h2> <a name="7th" id="7th">7th Party Member Mode</a></h2>
If you need the party slot for someone else, Brandock can be kicked out of the party and told to "stay close", then he will follow as a "familiar" or, as I call it "7th party member". If in 7th party member mode he needs to join the group from time to time to level up. In 7th party member mode Brandock can be selected and given commands, as well as told to use quick slot items. All his dialogues, banters, and interjections will trigger as normal.<br />
To rejoin the group, talk to him and tell him you need "access to (his) inventory", and he will rejoin as a full party member. If you time this accordingly, the moment he is in group before any other kicked out NPC reaches the PC for his post-kickout dialogue is sufficient to let Brandock level up and rearrange his spells and items, without having to finally kick out any other party NPC to achieve this. (Unless those just leave without a follow-up dialogue, of course.)<br />
He cannot die while following as a 7th party member, but will remain at 1 HP. If Brandock's HP fall to 1 HP during a fight, he will pass out. Healing him then will not change this. He will change to "neutral blue" so enemies stop attacking him. Once the fight is over, he will regain consciousness, be healed fully, and rejoin the party as a "familiar" as before. The full healing might be seen as a cheat, but it's one way to fix the engine behavior (not to call it bug) with Brandock dying upon rejoining if his HP are too low.<br />
The 1 HP drop out can be prevented if Brandock is healed in time during a fight. If told to he will give a warning before his HP drop too low, but this seems to be buggy in BGT.<br />
<br />
NOTE TO PLAYERS: <br />
Unfortunately, the "7th party member mode" in the game requires special handling to accommodate all restrictions: 
(The hints are a mix of the existing engine restrictions and the workarounds I used).<br />
-The NPC has no "Clear Fog of War" around him in the 7th GM. So he can "disappear" in the "black" area of the map. Unfortunately, this can lead to Brandock no longer be included in the "gather all party" button although he is still green circled and will return properly with the group as soon as he is seen by a full party member again. This is especially annoying if he loses sight of full party members because the AI wanted him to walk to whatever destination on a different path, and he needs to be searched for by walking the map until he can be seen again. This seems to be especially a problem if several "7th party members" follow, and with the old game engine.<br />
-Items in the NPC's inventory are *not* recognized as items owned by the group. This is an engine problem. It follows that quest items that are needed in the game should not be in the NPC's inventory if they are to be recognized by the quest giver. Examples: Elvenhair's book, Ankheg shell for Taerom, etc.<br />
-Quest items tagged as "critical" will be moved to the PC's inventory when moving to the 7th PMM. This may cause items from the PC's inventory to end up on the floor. This is an engine problem. As a result, you should always check after switching the NPC to the 7th PMM to see if items have landed on the floor!<br />
-When new items are given to one of my NPCs in 7th PMM in a quest specifically for this NPC, they always appear in the inventory of the group or PC, even if the NPC is supposed to receive them. This is an engine problem. Even if I scripted it so that the items would end up in the NPC's inventory after the encounter, they would still be handled via the PC's inventory. And thus, items from the inventory may have ended up on the floor.<br />
-For my NPCs, I have tried to have their own quest items (even if they are original in-game items, as long as they are necessary for my NPC's quest) recognized in the NPC's inventory as well. This works with the following restrictions:<br />
-- All items in question are handled through the PC's inventory before they are either given to or received from a quest giver. This means that other items may have ended up on the floor.<br />
-- If the item was in a bottomless bag (this includes all kind of bags, gem bags, bags for bottles etcpp.), then the item will not be removed in a dialogue with the quest giver. It is still in the bottomless bag afterwards and can cause problems if the scripting of the quest does not consider this (and assumes that the item should be gone).<br />
-- 2. Problem with items in bottomless bags: If the item was in a bottomless bag, then the game crashes for unknown reasons if the NPC is to be taken afterwards into the group as a full member. This "crash bug" can be worked around by saving the game and reloading it.<br />
<br />
</div>

<h1><a name="issues" id="issues">Known Issues</a></h1>
<div class="section">
<br />
Short summary of things to keep in mind while playing in 7th party member mode:<br />
-After each quest event and after moving to the 7th PMM, check whether the PC has lost items from the inventory that should be picked back up from the floor.<br />
-Save before adding a 7th PM back to the group. If the game then crashes, reload the save game. This should prevent the crash from occurring.<br />
-It is necessary and also recommended to have non-critical quest items not in the inventory of the 7th GM but in that of the normal party members.<br />
-Take quest items out of bottomless bags in the 7th PM's inventory before approaching the appropriate quest givers, or at least save the game to prevent the "crash bug" before taking the NPC back as a full PM.<br />
-In some game cutscenes, Brandock might be visible at places where he shouldn't be as 7th party member. This can only be prevented by explicitely considering Brandock in the relevant scripts. Some will be covered in later versions.</br>
-Items in Brandock's inventory will not be recognized by quest givers. Exception is some custom mod items for which I specifically scripted in that they are being noticed.</br>
-Brandock has no clear fog of war effect. (The reason is that the engines cannot handle more than 8 creatures with CFoW - and that includes the 6 party members and cutscene spies.) So when following as 7th party member, he might "vanish" behind the line of sight and stop walking. He will then no longer come to a meeting point but needs to be back in visual range of a party member to be activated again. </br>
