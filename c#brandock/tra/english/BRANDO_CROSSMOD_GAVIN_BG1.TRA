@0  = ~Gavin, your sister is a mage? You know I am from Amn and how mages are treated there. Hearing about how you and your sister grew up together, with your sister's talent being just one minor detail in your daily lives... I am envious of the support of your family, of... how she was allowed to grow up like a *normal* child.~
@1  = ~Yes, hearing of her upbringing must be unusual for you, just as hearing about your upbringing is unusual for me.~
@2  = ~Unusual, yes, but oh how I would have longed to be able to live like that. But yes, unusual and I would have never dared to hope for something like that for *me*. It's now as an adult that I understand what could have been if the situation were different. It's the same for my parents. They believed it to be the best for me because we just couldn't imagine any other way.~
@3  = ~And, sadly, they might not have known how to handle your gift even if they wanted to. I do think that in the end, families everywhere want their children to grew up the best way they can provide.~
@4  = ~Oh definitely. My parents wanted the best for me, I am sure of that. Given the circumstances, maybe their belief that growing up with a Cowled Wizard was the best thing that could happen to me was a lucky coincidence because they wouldn't have had a chance to change it, anyway.~
@5  = ~That is one hardship of being a parent, I think. You can have so many plans and dreams for your child... but in the end, you need to make compromises with what reality provides.~
