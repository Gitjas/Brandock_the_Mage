@0    = ~I grew up in the greatest library of Faerûn, you know.~
@1    = ~Necromancy! I don't like it. We have to take that madman down quickly, <CHARNAME>, or his skeletons will take down us.~
@2    = ~Wait, what? Poisoned? When, how ... what?!~
@3    = ~To atone for an involuntary murder of your own family. I do not envy you, Captain Brage. Not at all. Your path will be a hard one...~
@4    = ~Do not call me captain. I shamed and lost that title forever. My poor family...~
@5    = ~Wow, I can't believe we really defeated your 'half-brother'. Hmm. The way that Sarevok was shocked when you struck him down... So much disbelief. He really didn't expect this to happen, it seems. I felt almost little sorry for him. Almost.~
@6    = ~<CHARNAME>, those might be only snippets and pieces but the remains of that book really mean a lot to me. We need to go back and collect them as soon as possible.~
@7    = ~<CHARNAME>, the De Simplex Magicae really means a lot to me. It's not finished yet and I need to guard it until it will be. We need to go back and collect it as soon as possible.~
@8    = ~<CHARNAME>, I asked you to return so we could collect my book. This did not happen so I'll have to go search for it myself. Farewell.~
@9    = ~To be on the look-out for an assassination target in a tavern is understandable. But to actually *attack* inside the tavern speaks of a high opinion of one's fighting prowess.~ [c#ablank]
@10   = ~Hmm, Nashkel is Amnish soil, <CHARNAME>. Having trouble in the mine - magic trouble, as it seems, surely is of high interest to the Cowled Wizards.~ [c#ablank]
@11   = ~The Cowled Wizards are the official organization of Amnish mages, as you probably know. They are very powerful... very powerful.~
@12   = ~I'm just saying... This would be of interest to me as well. Helping to clear the mines will surely earn us bonus points with the Cowled Wizards. Bonus points with them are always good.~
@13   = ~Well, what am I saying? Of course they care, considering they sent a Cowled Wizard here to investigate...~
@14   = ~Well, yes, we are most definitely a long way from Athkatla, Amnish soil or no. Having magic thrown inside a tavern like this without *anyone* taking notice is so definitely *not* Amnish.~ [c#ablank]
@15   = ~Being ambushed by an assassin is, though.~
@16   = ~Although I am surprised by the determination in which she was looking for *you*.~
@17   = ~Must be because of these nice pictures of you some people are carrying around...~
@18   = ~I do start to get used to that...~
@19   = ~What a nightmare! My sincerest condolences.~
@20   = ~(mumbles) Didn't I speak of exactly *that*? (sigh)~
@21   = ~Thank you. (sniff)~
@22   = ~(mumbles) Oh gods, do *I* sound like him?~
@23   = ~The tainted ore stops at *no one*, as it seems.~
@24   = ~There you go - iron gear broke. I hope you have enough in stock, because this sight is just too depressing.~
@25   = ~Wait - that could be the ogre who is camping in front of the cave where I located my belongings! Two birds, one stone, right?~
@26   = ~Balduran's...?! Balduran's ship wreck! What a thrilling thought. Travelling with you is getting better and better. Imagine what we could learn!~
@27   = ~Stealing... I am not fond of stealing. I hope there is another way to retrieve these sea charts.~
@28   = ~(whispers) A witness to Balduran's last days... <CHARNAME>, please let this man tell his tale!~
@29   = ~Perhaps you should tell us your tale.~
@30   = ~Are we really stranded on this island? Like, *stranded*? Like, no ship for leaving, and... and no shipbuilder, and probably not enough wood, and... (inhales)~ [c#ablank]
@31   = ~Calm yourself, Brandock. I'm sure there must be a way off this island. There always is.~
@32   = ~Look, there is even a town nearby. All will be well.~
@33   = ~I'm as shocked as you, but we'll have to make the best of it.~
@34   = ~We don't know that yet, do we?~
@35   = ~Shut up, Brandock.~
@36   = ~I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. I am sorry... I need to be frantic for just a little longer, but I promise I will be quiet about it.~
@37   = ~Gods. To be trapped in a hostile surrounding, *and* losing one's spellbook. What a nightmare. I can't help but sympathize with trapped mages. Trapped, magicless mages! I lack a lack of empathy in this regard, so to say. (shivers)~ [c#ablank]
@38   = ~And here I was, being so happy that *this* time we wouldn't meet trapped mages like there were on the ice island. Considering we don't have a way home, at least *this* could have been different? No?...~
@39   = ~That we killed him doesn't make it better. No...~
@40   = ~I didn't mean to be rude back there, but why would a mage go on such an expedition and leave his spellbook in his cabin?~
@41   = ~Funny how he survived all these years so we could meet him now...~
@42   = ~Yes, good thing *we* didn't get stranded on an island full of hostile lycanthropes. Oops...~
@43   = ~A horrible thought, indeed.~
@44   = ~I am more troubled by our own fate.~
@45   = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, that *is* rude. Everyone is smarter after it happened. I guess he suffered enough in the meantime to make up for his foolishness.~
@46   = ~But I do appreciate you didn't say it to his face. Seemed a bit on edge, the good elf.~
@47   = ~Maybe you could have asked him that, instead of provoking him to a fight-to-death.~
@48   = ~But honestly... I am surprised as well.~
@49   = ~Hm? Are we getting a bit self-centered? I am sure he wasn't placed by the gods onto this island so *we* could ask about Balduran's last days. He was lucky when the fighting started, and he is an elf, so he outlived any other survivors. ...Alone. (shivers again)~
@50   = ~(moans) I am trying hard not to think about that detail, <CHARNAME>.~
@51   = ~All I can say is - from now on, I'll take my spell book wherever I go. Everywhere. Maybe not inside a bathtub. But definitely when I go... behind the bushes, you know. I mean it!~
@52   = ~Ooooh, the last possible eye witness of Balduran, and we had to kill him! ... Did we really, <CHARNAME>?~ [c#ablank]
@53   = ~Balduran's Logbook!~ [c#ablank]
@54   = ~Could I?... Could I have it, just for a short moment?~
@55   = ~This is it! It describes his last moments. Up to the point where he still found the time to write, of course. The pages are old and worn, we need to treat this with care. And...~
@56   = ~The History of the Nether Scrolls. What a magnificent book!~ [c#ablank]
@57   = ~Could I?...~
@58   = ~I do confess I don't understand a word. But it's an honor to even hold this.~
@59   = ~(inhales) This... (Whispers, still staring at the book.) This is a 10,000 gold book. Oh - my - gods. <CHARNAME>? <CHARNAME>?! Take this out of my hands, please? You put this somewhere safe. Preferably somewhere far away from me. Before... before *something* happens!~
@60   = ~Er, Ajantis? You so kindly promised. Would you... would you take it, please?!~
@61   = ~Ajantis?...~
@62   = ~And I will put this back veeeery carefully...~
@63   = ~Whut - no, nono. <CHARNAME>, you take this book away from me. You can't consider me taking care of this valuable book? Not seriously? I mean...~ [c#ablank]
@64   = ~(sigh) Thank you for your trust... I guess.~
@65   = ~Phew, that should cure our risk of turning into a werewolf!~ [c#ablank]
@66   = ~Er, ours, that is. Yours probably not.~
@67   = ~I held my tongue back there on that island, we were busy fighting. But I was quite at unease considering the situation. I have no intention of adding lycanthropy to the list of my misfortunes... Although... I already kind of *did*?~
@68   = ~I am glad we won't be changing into this. Very glad.~
@69   = ~No offense.~
@70   = ~Well, it was an unexpected adventure to be sure.~
@71   = ~As you said, I went through all this and made use of it.~
@72   = ~I am glad it's over, too.~
@73   = ~What can I say - 'Balduran's Logbook'!~
@74   = ~Yes, I got it. It's over, so let's go.~
@75   = ~But what were we thinking. Who was he, to receive Balduran's Logbook? I was so eager to read through it, myself, to think any further than my own nose. No more 'expeditions' from people we hardly know and have a shady appearance, <CHARNAME>, promise? Leave it to shiny members of well-known authorities to trick us in the future.~
@76   = ~Oh, yes!~
@77   = ~A... a magic isle, full of trapped mages that were drawn here... I really thought this was a joke. Well, not a joke as in jesting, but something not real. You know, fictitious.~ [c#ablank]
@78   = ~I can imagine that this can be quite frightening for a mage.~
@79   = ~I agree, this is really frightening.~
@80   = ~Where have you heard about it?~
@81   = ~Seems quite real to me...~
@82   = ~I don't want to talk about it.~
@83   = ~Oh yes! It is, indeed.~
@84   = ~Then I will be quiet. Just let me tell you that I might have happened to end up here... If my first teacher wouldn't have stopped me in time from performing a teleportation spell I didn't know *was* one.~
@85   = ~It all comes back so promptly. I haven't thought about this detail in years! And now my knees are shaking, because I realize he could have saved me. I know chances are low I'd have teleported across the sea, but still... The thought of being trapped here... Probably crazy like these poor chaps, really shatters me!~
@86   = ~Good we have a way back! I mean... we *do* have a way back, yes?...~
@87   = ~<CHARNAME>, you know, I am not much better than this Melicamp apprentice of Thalantyr was.~
@88   = ~No, I am not referring to whatever happened while trying to help poor chicken Melicamp! Although I do see that this description would fit there, too.~
@89   = ~It was before I was magically trained, and my master stopped me just in time. He wasn't my master then, because I experimented with my magic powers before anyone actually realized what was going on, but he took me on soon enough.~
@90   = ~I already told you about this - the runes in my teacher's bag. What I didn't tell you is the spell on the rune I was reading.~
@91   = ~It was teleportation magic! Teleportation, you see? I still see that look on his face when he wrenched the then glowing rune out of my hands...~
@92   = ~I do wonder about my first teacher, <CHARNAME>. Since we talked about him while visiting, I mean, 'visiting', the Ice Island, I can't help but to think of him. There are things I forgot... or tried to ignore, more likely. Something that feels wrong, thinking about it now.~ [c#ablank]
@93   = ~What do you mean?~
@94   = ~Was he mean to you?~
@95   = ~I am not interested in this.~
@96   = ~Only three months after he took me on, I was transferred to a Cowled Wizard for training. A lot of them came to our house, all hooded in their brownish cloaks, and they said to my teacher he had to leave - and he just nodded.~
@97   = ~They told me my first teacher had to leave on urgent business and to pack my things. I was told to hush when I asked what the business was. They said to seek an apprenticeship with a real mage since I was old enough, as that's how it's done in Amn.~
@98   = ~Meaning your first teacher wasn't official?~
@99   = ~But you think there was something wrong?~
@100  = ~Sounds like the official procedure, then.~
@101  = ~Know what - forget I asked. I don't want to hear more about your first teacher.~
@102  = ~No! Absolutely not. Think patient, think friendly, but also strict, and you have a good picture of him.~
@103  = ~You have a sharp mind. It took me years to come to this conclusion - in this very moment, actually.~
@104  = ~Definitely.~
@105  = ~Official, yes, but how does my first teacher fit into this?~
@106  = ~Thinking about him now, I have the impression he was expecting something to happen. You know, this nervousness some people radiate that you only notice afterwards, like a bad foreshadowing. The funny thing is that I didn't realize it, not even after I got transferred. It all comes back to me now.~
@107  = ~I am sorry to bore you with this, but it is really making my head spin.~
@108  = ~I always wondered why he would have to go with the Cowled Wizards. But it is *now* that I realize he most probably was forced to leave because he might have been in trouble! He could have been in trouble for teaching me, maybe he did it without accreditation by the Cowled Wizards, and they found out! The thought alone worries me.~
@109  = ~Ah, I could go on about this, but I know we have more important things to do.~
@110  = ~You definitely do not sleep well lately, <CHARNAME>. And... you waking up in a glowing aura kind of adds some creepiness, I have to admit. What is going on?~ [c#ablank]
@111  = ~I have bad dreams - dreams of a foreboding kind.~
@112  = ~I have nightmares, but I don't know what is going on.~
@113  = ~It's alright, nothing to worry about.~
@114  = ~The ways of the gods are mysterious. Maybe one of them chose you and is trying to get in contact, who knows. I'll be here, in case it's something else.~
@115  = ~Well, I have a suspicion of what is causing this. Godly blood has influence over you somehow. I'll be here, in case it boils too hot.~
@116  = ~By the Gods. I know I wanted to train my magic abilities, but this fight was pointless! What a powerful mage. What a waste of talent... Why did he attack us, again?~ [c#ablank]
@117  = ~But I will definitely have a look in his spell book. Something good has to come out of this...~
@118  = ~Oh... I... need to move slowly. Slowly... Ma-ma-maybe a rest would be good, soon.~ [c#ablank]
@119  = ~Ooooh, I will *so* regret this tomorrow.~ [c#ablank]
@120  = ~<CHARNAME>, I'd rather you wouldn't have me do this. I think being drunk is a bit (hiccup) humililililating.~ [c#ablank]
@121  = ~Ah. I just saw too many good people ruining themselves with too much ale, you know. But I'm not saying this doesn't taste well, oh no.~ [c#ablank]
@122  = ~Oh... I think that was one too many. Because, I think, if I see everything twice, tha-tha-that's one time too many.~ [c#ablank]
//@123  = 
@124  = ~Cells! And so many. How charming. Entering the headquarters through the cells. How fitting. Bring the citizens into line without doing much, huh? Or, demonstrating what the Flaming Fist are for. Or, that working here is all about duty! 'Stand away, citizen!'~ [c#ablank]
@125  = ~I have a bad feeling standing between all these cells. I feel ... threatened. I guess that is what happens if you grow up being a mage in Amn.~
@126  = ~Ah, a carnival... yes, they look the same everywhere, I guess. I spent quite some time with one myself, performing. With the blessing of the city's officials, of course. The pay was quite good, considering the circumstances.~ [c#ablank]
@127  = ~I had to save a lot of gold for my plans...~
@128  = ~Still pondering about that poor Captain and his berserker sword... To kill one's family while under such an evil influence. What a thought. What a horrible, awful, *terrifying* thought.~ [c#ablank]
@129  = ~I wonder if the righteous, the friendly, the steadfast, fall prey to such magic more easily? Is the effect of corruption stronger for them than for the murderous ones? Imagine an evil blackguard, full of lust for the slaughter taking up such a weapon. Would anyone even *notice*?~
@130  = ~Hm, good question.~
@131  = ~What a tasteless remark, Brandock. I am sure the captain's family *noticed* all right.~
@132  = ~'Hey! I am a cursed weapon! It's me, doing the slaughtering! Not that damned blackguard!'~
@133  = ~I never imagined life can go wrong for cursed weapons, too.~
@134  = ~I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. I'm just shocked by what happened. It keeps turning in my head and my mind starts producing these thoughts... to distract me from these horrors.~
@135  = ~The Sorcerous Sundries! I heard about this so, *so* far away. I have to go in there and take a peak at the magic wares at some point, <CHARNAME>. Pleeeeeeeeeease!~ [c#ablank]
@136  = ~Wow! This is ... wow! Look over there, it's a ... wow! ...~ [c#ablank]
@137  = ~I think I'll need to catch my breath before we do the actual trade with the shop keeper. My head feels like it's going to *explode*.~
@138  = ~Oh, dang, <CHARNAME>. He didn't make it. I was so hoping for a happy ending.~ [c#ablank]
@139  = ~Doppelgangers! Of *course*!~ [c#ablank]
@140  = ~The ghosts in Nashkel Mine turn out to be a small part of a larger criminal organization. And we just poked into the wasps nest, it seems. Something tells me that angry wasps would be preferable to what we *will* stir up... But, yes, I am at your side to continue these investigations, <CHARNAME>.~ [c#ablank]
@141  = ~To taint the ore. The ore! What a foul play. What is it for? What use do breakable weapons have? Apart from the obvious one, if it is your enemy who has them, of course. Gods, I could go on about this...~ [c#ablank]
@142  = ~A connection to the bandits! This is intriguing, <CHARNAME>. Intriguing and highly frightening... I suppose we will go there, yes? Well, yes. What else will shed more light onto this!~ [c#ablank]
@143  = ~And I will have a quick glance into this man's spellbook, while we are at it.~
@144  = ~Aaaaand again, we are looking for a higher level of the organization. The evil overlord! Well... let's go!~ [c#ablank]
@145  = ~Just in case anyone was about to ask, yes, I am frightened as hell.~
@146  = ~Er, nice picture. Of ... you. They didn't quite get the nose right, though? Sorry for making jokes about this, <CHARNAME>. This is serious matter.~ [c#ablank]
@147  = ~G... Gorion? Wait - <CHARNAME>... from Candlekeep?! How can I be so *daft*? Of course you are <CHARNAME>, Gorion's foster child. What do you... what do you mean, "tried" to protect you? Are you saying...?~
@148  = ~You knew about Gorion and me? How so?~
@149  = ~Gorion died when we got into an ambush.~
@150  = ~He's dead, Brandock.~
@151  = ~Why would you care?~
@152  = ~Seems like someone wants you dead, indeed? You don't have, by a chance, any idea who that would be?~
@153  = ~No, I don't.~
@154  = ~Well, Gorion tried to protect me from something, or someone...~
@155  = ~This being connected to you leaving Candlekeep, and Gorion being killed... This is not a threat to be trifled with.~
@156  = ~I have the impression that by traveling with you, I'll have more training possibilities to increase my magical prowess than I was actually expecting. Which is not a bad thing, per se. Just a bit... disturbing.~
@157  = ~I'm... I'm sorry, it was a tasteless remark, considering your situation. I said I will help you if you help me, and that hasn't changed. I'm not going to bail on you just because it's getting serious!~
@158  = ~What? Who wouldn't have known Gorion, the wise sage and powerful wizard, residing in Candlekeep? I mean, what *mage* wouldn't!~
@159  = ~Who?~
@160  = ~No, no, Xzar, I don't believe you mean that!~
@161  = ~Or monk. Or adventurer. Or - everyone? Well, I didn't knew him personally, of course, and about you I don't know much, well, nothing, to be honest, besides your name - and that only because you are foster child to Gorion.~
@162  = ~Please tell me... Is it true?~
@163  = ~What personal reasons?~
@164  = ~I seek wisdom, <CHARNAME>, and Candlekeep is the place to go for that on the Sword Coast. I'll tell you all about my plans if you want, but right now...~
@165  = ~I thank you.~
@166  = ~Let's get moving.~
@167  = ~I was... I was keenly interested in Gorion and Candlekeep, <CHARNAME>, for my personal reasons.~
@168  = ~So it *is* true? It really happened? Gods... And here I am, making jokes about bounty notes. I had no idea, <CHARNAME>! I am so sorry for your loss!~
@169  = ~You see why I wanted help, Brandock.~
@170  = ~I don't know much about you, besides your name. I was interested in Gorion, mainly. I didn't knew him personally, of course, but who wouldn't have known Gorion, the wise sage and powerful wizard, residing in Candlekeep?~
@171  = ~Let's go on and make sure whoever it is doesn't get a hand on you. Or us. Or... me. Ahem.~
@172  = ~I... I definitely do, yes.~
@173  = ~You have no idea who would be after you?~
@174  = ~No. Let's get moving.~
@175  = ~As much as I understand the sentiment - from your perspective, that is, I beg you to consider that I am bound to you, and probably doomed with you, now that we are travelling together.~
@176  = ~You'll learn soon enough.~
@177  = ~This was never a good approach, <CHARNAME>. Never. Better share the info, and not let us walk into our doom. ...Please!~
@178  = ~Wow... what happened here? Look at all the traces of fierce, destructive magic!~ [c#ablank]
@179  = ~Is it ... is it here that Gorion died? The traces of the fight are still visible, even after all the time that passed! The magic invoked here was mighty ...~
@180  = ~Yep, that's the spot. Poor Gorion...~
@181  = ~Yes, that's the place where it happened.~
@182  = ~I don't want to talk about it, Brandock.~
@183  = ~This must have been a mighty battle, if there are traces still visible.~
@184  = ~I know what happened here... but <CHARNAME> should tell you <PRO_HIMHER>self!~
@185  = ~Gorion and I were ambushed here.~
@186  = ~The traces are from Gorion's magic, Brandock.~
@187  = ~Whatever, it's past.~
@188  = ~That it definitely is.~
@189  = ~Ahh, come on, <CHARNAME>! Oh well, I guess you will learn with time, Brandock.~
@190  = ~<CHARNAME>, if whoever ambushed you and Gorion gets ahold of us any time soon, I promise you, I promise you, I'll probably die a spectacular death. Fighting at your side, I mean.~
@191  = ~G... Gorion? Wait - <CHARNAME>... from Candlekeep?! How can I be so *daft*? Of course you are <CHARNAME>, Gorion's foster child. What do you... what do you mean, Gorion had to fight? Are you saying...?~
@192  = ~How would you know about me?~
@193  = ~He is dead? He is really dead?~
@194  = ~Then I must assume that it is true... Gorion is dead...~
@195  = ~Gods, <CHARNAME>, and here I am, marveling at the traces of powerful magics, while you lost your father, your home... I am sorry for your loss!~
@196  = ~It's alright. Let's move on.~
@197  = ~I am glad I can be of service. I really mean it.~
@198  = ~Hm, Thalantyr is a great mage. Very peculiar, but great. And wise, and famous. Had I not lost my reputation as a mage by destroying the book, I could ask him to take me on as an apprentice...~ [c#ablank]
@199  = ~Argh, what nonsense! Had I not destroyed that book I'd be in Candlekeep now!...~
@200  = ~Is it over *now*? Wow, that was... impressive. Did you see the way that mage hopped through the rooms at the beginning of the fight?~ [c#ablank]
@201  = ~(scoff) Did he? I hardly noticed!~
@202  = ~Of course!~
@203  = ~Yeah, looked like wild magic. I've heard you can achieve wondrous things using wild magic!~
@204  = ~What? Oh, yeah. Very funny, <CHARNAME>.~
@205  = ~I have to stay a minute or two and have a look at his books. Please, <CHARNAME>? Only a few minutes.~
@206  = ~Yes, but be careful. There could be traps around, still.~
@207  = ~No, Brandock. I need us all to be ready and on alert in case there are more enemies around.~
@208  = ~Ah, that make sense... Dang.~
@209  = ~I will. I'll be right over there!~
@210  = ~(sigh) Don't judge me, <CHARNAME>, but I have to say it... Davaeorn was a great mage. With apprentices. An evil man, but a great mage. I am used to evil mages. But - nah, I left evil mages to leave this type of situation behind. Alright, let us move on. Nothing to see here. And he is dead, anyway.~ [c#ablank]
@211  = ~Doppelgangers. Doppelgangers! I hate it if they cooperate. Why are they here?~ [c#ablank]
/* same as @18 in BRANDO_CROSSMOD_BREAGAR.TRA! */
@212  = ~Secret mines! Secret mines, now *that* makes sense. Taint the official ore, use and sell the good ore yourself, from a secret mine. Oh, and blame everything onto the neighboring lands and stir up a war. Who would play little, if he can play big?~ [c#ablank]
@213  = ~Being arrested for murder - fals accusations, I might add - is scaring me more than any monster threat could have. More than being trapped inside a foe's dungeon, even. - I know it's no surprise to anyone that I feel scared. But... this is more intense.~
@214  = ~Any chance half-ogre Brandock could break us out of here?~
@215  = ~Well, in a way this *is* an evil foe's dungeon... But I know what you mean.~
@216  = ~Why, I think 'being arrested for murder' would be something you still needed to add to your list of failures.~
@217  = ~Just give me time to work this out. We will get out of here.~
@218  = ~Believe me, I'm not satisfied either.~
@219  = ~[Brandock]Of course not. I know how we got here. I am counting on us to get *out* of here, though.~
@220  = ~Is that an accusation? What would you have me do?~
@221  = ~(sigh) And it worked so well until now! For a moment, I really felt like we were saving the Sword Coast... Now I'm not even sure we can save ourselves.~
@222  = ~Ouch, <CHARNAME>!~
@223  = ~Er, <CHARNAME>, are we to enter Durlag's Tower? I heard tales about it when I was young. Stories of unthinkable riches, traps, monsters and the adventurers who went in and never found their way out.~ [c#ablank]
@224  = ~Just saying.~
@225  = ~(sigh) Poor people. Doppelgangers infiltrating the family clan! A home, invaded by doppelgangers, slowly taking over the population, the remaining going mad in their despair and terror. This tower tells of a terrifying, and also very, very sad story.~ [c#ablank]
@226  = ~This is *the* manifestation of a nightmare, in my opinion. To have your family members replaced by doppelgangers! I think doppelgangers are the most horrible monsters in these realms. Right there with vampires, werewolves, phase spiders, zombies, Ghouls, dragons, demons...~
@227  = ~I hope you are holding up alright, <CHARNAME>. After what we saw in Candlekeep...~
@228  = ~I *also* think the whole tower is quite scary. You know, what I said when we were still outside...~
@229  = ~Wow, I never thought going with you would turn out like this. You know, ending the bandit threat, which was a great achievement in itself. Stopping the spread of that cursed tainted ore - I would grant us knighthood for that one. But also stopping the rising war between the Sword Coast and my home land, as we striving to do now.~ [c#ablank]
@230  = ~And I thought it would be a normal adventurer's life giving me opportunity to improve the skills of my profession. I never expected us to become heroes in the real sense.~
@231  = ~Of course, there's that *tiny* little problem with us still being wanted and accused of murder, but I am sure we will fix this soon, too.~
/* @232 - @238 in brandock_bookrestore_bg1.d */
@232  = ~We did it! We cleared our names and saved the Dukes - for now. And we confronted Sarevok! Well, kind of. Sarevok, who apparently is the murderer of your foster father, Gorion! How do you feel?~ [c#ablank]
@233  = ~Ready to chase him down and end this for good.~
@234  = ~I am glad we could save the Dukes. I'll go after him, but more because I want to end the threat to the Sword Coast, not out of personal revenge.~
@235  = ~How would I feel? He teleported away, the coward.~
@236  = ~I don't want to talk about this.~
@237  = ~The situation has turned - now he is the hunted one. Let's go and stop him for good.~
@238  = ~That's fine by me.~
@239  = ~Ah, the problems of a servant. I left the master's fine boots outside overnight, and now they are gone. This has to be a prank by the town's youth, or who would steal worn boots? A fine pair, though. (sigh) If I don't find them soon, I'll have to confess to Master Travenhurst that they are lost.~
@240  = ~Ah, it's a nuisance, these youngsters! Nothing but full of mischief, and I have to stand up to my master for it.~
@241  = ~Oh, but what do I see? The master's boots! You found them! But... bite marks?! Foxes! The foxes took 'em? Luckily I can wipe those off. Some fat and elbow grease and them boots'll shine as new. Hmph. Means I did them youngsters wrong - this time. Thank you, good <PRO_SIRMAAM>. I appreciate your effort to bring them here. Take this as a small reward from a servant. Now, off I'll go, polishing boots!~
@242  = ~The ogre is dead, I take it!~ [c#ablank]
@243  = ~So, nothing is hindering us from going into that cave. Possessions, here I come. Heh, er, yes. <CHARNAME>, we should be careful as to what awaits us in there. Xvarts, goblins? Or maybe a bear? Wolves?!~
@244  = ~You killed it without me, I see. Well, that was easier than I thought! Heh. Er, yes. Let's go inside the cave and look around for my possessions. I so hope they are still inside!~
@245  = ~I am thankful you are doing this with me, <CHARNAME>.~
@246  = ~Oh no- nononononono. No.~ [c#ablank]
@247  = ~Gods, no!~
@248  = ~What is the matter?~
@249  = ~Stop fussing. Take your stuff and let's go.~
@250  = ~<CHARNAME>, do you see this? Do you see this pathetic pile of paper? Yes, this, this ... (Brandock flips a bundle of pages in his hands.) ... this pile of torn, gnawed-upon paper ...~
@251  = ~What kind of animal *does* that? But I already know it. There is no way of missing that smell. Foxes! Those little bastards you never get to see, because they are so shy. Came to my campsite and stole the book that was meant to be my entrance fee to Candlekeep to gnaw it into shreds. This - is - not - true!~
@252  = ~Please tell me it is not true.~
@253  = ~I'm afraid it seems to be so.~
@254  = ~Candlekeep? This book was worth *10,000* gold?!~
@255  = ~Foxes... It was good to go into this cave well prepared, indeed. Imagine what they could have done to us!~
@256  = ~Foxes would do something like that?~
@257  = ~I appreciate you having your fun. It's actually a good joke. Ha! But...~
@258  = ~Yes. And so much more... so much more, the wisdom in it alone!~
@259  = ~Goooooods...~
@260  = ~I am very sorry, Brandock.~
@261  = ~Those little fox teeth destroyed my most precious possession and with it my future life plan, which is more than any of the monsters I have so far faced have managed to do.~
@262  = ~This... book should have been my entry into Candlekeep. I wanted to go to Candlekeep and study. This is what I wanted to do. At least some pages are still readable...~
@263  = ~Oh, and there's also a nice pair of boots with little fox bites. Could be returned to their owners, I reckon. Do you think they would notice if I gnaw on them a bit myself, first?~
@264  = ~Please, give me a minute. I need to regain my composure.~
@265  = ~(moans) That didn't work as planned. The plan was to regain the book and travel with you until my debt was cleared. Then go to Candlekeep and take my first steps towards becoming a world renowned wizard. The reality is - the book's disintegrated into colored paper snippets and Candlekeep is probably closed forever. And I'm devastated!~ [c#ablank]
@266  = ~Maybe the Gatewarden will still accept it if I say it's a do-it-yourself-10,000-gold-book, you know, one of these real life object puzzles? (groans)~
@267  = ~I am really sorry, Brandock.~
@268  = ~You wanted to study in Candlekeep?~
@269  = ~You had an entry book to Candlekeep but now it's destroyed? This is tragic for me, too! I could have gone home with you!~
@270  = ~Bad things happen.~
@271  = ~Yes, I want to become a great, well-versed wizard, and so far my plan was to take the first step by studying magic in Candlekeep.~
@272  = ~This is tragic for me, too. I grew up in Candlekeep, but now that Gorion is gone, I cannot return, because they don't let *anyone* in without a valuable book. To think that you had such a book in your possession...~
@273  = ~What will you do now?~
@274  = ~Oh, I see! But, would we have met in time? Maybe I would have already entered Candlekeep by the time Gorion... I apologize for rising the topic. I mean, maybe we would have met on the street, but would not have combined forces. Probably just said "hello" when passing by. And then *you* would have had need of re-entering, and I would have learned, that Gorion... I mean...~
@275  = ~...And it is of absolutely no use to imagine all this, because it didn't happen...~
@276  = ~Thank you.~
@277  = ~Ha! Yes, I guess so. You have a ... refreshingly unemotional view on things.~
@278  = ~Bad things do happen, but I usually prefer them happening far away from me. Note to the gods: this does *not* include foxes tearing apart my most precious possession in a faraway cave while I am sleeping!~
@279  = ~This is a serious question, <CHARNAME> - what am I supposed to do now?~
@280  = ~Let me give you your reward, before I drown in my self-pity. I won't start arguing about whether we actually recovered my book, because it was clear it was about you helping me to get to it... which we did... so here it is.~
@281  = ~I... I have nowhere to go now... I will stay with you then, longer than anticipated. I can stay with you, yes? Just for a while, until I... I rearrange my plans for what to do...~
@282  = ~What else would you say leaves such a messy and *smelly* cave? Oh, they like to steal things. There was this pair of boots there, as well. And they are with cubs currently, this time of year... The cubs probably need things to... train... their... teeth... (moans)~
@283  = ~G... Gorion? Wait - <CHARNAME>... from Candlekeep?! How can I be so *daft*? Of course you are <CHARNAME>, Gorion's foster child. What do you... what do you mean, "gone"? Are you saying...?~
@284  = ~...And I just lost a magic book of unmentionable worth. No, I did not "lose" it. I *destroyed* it! (Brandock groans and wipes his face with his palm.)~
@285  = ~I am sorry this happened. No one is safe it seems.~
@286  = ~He's dead? He is really dead? Gods, <CHARNAME>, and here I am, mourning my own clumsiness, while you lost your father, your home... I am sorry for your loss!~
@287  = ~<CHARNAME>, can you believe in so much bad luck... or is it me? Here is this 10,000 gold book, gnawed to shreds by foxes after they stole it from my campsite - while I was happily snoring with it on my lap.~ [c#ablank]
@288  = ~And then there is that... incident including a half-ogre, after I cast magic on someone I didn't know anything about, ruining my reputation as a mage around these lands for time to come.~
@289  = ~Is this just bad luck or is it my clumsiness?~
@290  = ~Both, I think. You are good-hearted, but also a bit too trustful.~
@291  = ~It's bad luck, Brandock. It all could have gone completely different.~
@292  = ~It's you. Your judging of situations and actions to be taken is not the best.~
@293  = ~It's just you, and I would add stupidity and naiveté to the list.~
@294  = ~Ouch. But, yes, that is how I feel right now. (sigh)~
@295  = ~Ever heard about leading by motivation?...~
@296  = ~Yes, I guess you are right.~
@297  = ~That is very nice of you to say, but is a rabbit not guilty of his own death, if it can't avoid the trap?~
@298  = ~Gods, I could huddle in that fox cave and hide for a while, I can tell you that.~
@299  = ~So, <CHARNAME>, would you be ready to share a bit of information about yourself? I know your name, and I see your profession.~ [c#ablank]
@300  = ~I understood that you and Imoen were acquainted before you started adventuring.~
@301  = ~Yep! You bet.~
@302  = ~So, what led you to travelling the Sword Coast?~
@303  = ~I grew up in Candlekeep. I was Gorion's foster child, but we had to leave in a hurry... Gorion was killed, and now I can't return.~
@304  = ~Actually I wanted to go adventuring all my life. Still, I didn't start it by my own plans.~
@305  = ~It is all a shock, I'm still not quite adjusted to the new situation. All of a sudden, Gorion is gone and I'm stuck outside my home of Candlekeep.~
@306  = ~I wouldn't know why this is of interest to you.~
@307  = ~<CHARNAME>, I am very sorry about your loss. To lose your father, and with him your home at the same time... Do you want to talk about it?~ [c#ablank]
@308  = ~It all happened so fast, Brandock. One moment, I am all cozy and protected inside the great Candlekeep library, running between the monk's legs. Next, it's assassins and ambushes and my foster father dying.~
@309  = ~No.~
@310  = ~Of course.~
@311  = ~That sounds awful.~
@312  = ~It is. (sigh)~
@313  = ~I'll be alright, I guess.~
@314  = ~And I cannot return to Candlekeep. My home! They won't let me in because I don't have a valuable book.~
@315  = ~I don't want to talk more about it.~
@316  = ~Yes, the famous entry fee to Candlekeep. This is very bad.~
@317  = ~You know, Gorion's death leaves a great hole in this world. He was the greatest and wisest. There are many who will miss him. Me, for example. I ... didn't know him. But I ... would have liked to have known him. To learn from him...~
@318  = ~I know this isn't a comfort for you. But perhaps the thought that others will miss him, too...~
@319  = ~Some people say time heals all wounds, but I think all that happens is a thick layer of moss grows over the things one would like to forget. If you are lucky, it's soft and keeps you warm. If you are unlucky, it starts dripping and there are small things living in it.~
@320  = ~<CHARNAME>, seriously - would you just give me a firm hit on my head when I start talking like that?~
@321  = ~I wanted to say I am sorry for your loss. I hope I did it without sounding disrespectful. I also do understand that you are currently in a very unsettling situation, and I am happy to be of help.~
@322  = ~Well, we are travelling together, so...~
@323  = ~We don't need to know anything about each other. Just be a good mage, Brandock, that's all I need.~
@324  = ~G... Gorion? Wait, <CHARNAME>... from Candlekeep! I am so *daft*, of course! You would be Gorion's foster child... but... he is dead?!~
@325  = ~Yes, my foster father is dead.~
@326  = ~That is what happened.~
@327  = ~We all have to die eventually.~
@328  = ~No? How did it came to it, then? If you don't mind my curiosity.~
@329  = ~Actually, I do mind. It's none of your business.~
@330  = ~Pffffuh, alright, I guess that should work, too.~
@331  = ~Yes, that we do, but...~
@332  = ~Gods, <CHARNAME>, and here I am, trying to draw you into a casual chat, while you lost your father, your home...~
@333  = ~Is it.. is it really true?~
@334  = ~Nashkel (sigh). Didn't think I would be so soon back to..., er, back to here, I mean in Amnish lands. But Nashkel is different from southern Amn, believe me. Oh yes, it is.~ [c#ablank]
@335  = ~You know this why?~
@336  = ~You've been here before?~
@337  = ~You know about Amn and how it treats its mages?~
@338  = ~Yes, I know that magic is despised and controlled in Amn.~
@339  = ~Haha, you grew up in Candlekeep? Er... you... you grew up IN CANDLEKEEP?! Wait, <CHARNAME>... from Candlekeep! I am so *daft*, of course! You would be Gorion's foster child!~
@340  = ~Ah yes, so you heard.~
@341  = ~G... Gorion? He is dead?!~
@342  = ~Are you deaf?~
@343  = ~Em - because it's Candlekeep, THE greatest library? Dream of... of, well, many mages in these lands?...~
@344  = ~I don't know much about you, besides your name. I was interested in Gorion, mainly. I don't know him personally, of course, but who wouldn't know Gorion, the wise sage and powerful wizard, residing in Candlekeep?~
@345  = ~What made you leave the library?~
@346  = ~Why shouldn't I leave it?~
@347  = ~Gods, <CHARNAME>, and here I am, babbling about where I'm from, while you lost your father, your home... I am sorry for your loss!~
@348  = ~It's alright. How do you know so much about Amn?~
@349  = ~It's getting late. Let's move on.~
@350  = ~Well, the lands north from the Cloud Peaks are a bit... less fanatic about this. The people's mentality is different for one, but also the presence of Cowled Wizards is far less common.~
@351  = ~Of course, I forgot for a moment where you grew up.~
@352  = ~Erm, well, I mean... I, er... Gods, I was hoping not to have to tell this, but there is no use in hiding, either. (takes a deep breath)~
@353  = ~Well, Nashkel is still Amnish soil so... let's just be careful and not raise any suspicion, just to be sure.~
@354  = ~Sure. I will be quiet.~
@355  = ~<CHARNAME>, I tried to avoid the subject, but we are travelling together longer than I imagined at first.~ [c#ablank]
@356  = ~I, well. I am from Amn. But I am not a spy! I swear. Which is exactly the thing a spy would do? But no, I think a spy would have such a failproof alibi and backstory you would never even have the faintest idea he would be from Amn. *Or* a spy would make up a story as pathetic as mine to try and be convincing.~
@357  = ~Er, is it believable?~
@358  = ~You tried to avoid the subject? What do you mean?~
@359  = ~Is what believable? Are you a spy or not?~
@360  = ~You had to come all this way for what you want to achieve?~
@361  = ~From Amn?! What are you doing here on the Sword Coast at a time like this?~
@362  = ~I couldn't care less where you are from. Cross me and you will regret it.~
@363  = ~What? NO! I said I am not.~
@364  = ~Making a fool out of myself, mostly...~
@365  = ~Oh, yes. We can have a long, extended talk about what Amn thinks of mages in general later, <CHARNAME>.~
@366  = ~It's called bad timing. I set out to become a great, wise mage. I cannot do that in Amn, not with a soul that is able to feel empathy. Er, I did *not* imply that great, powerful mages in Amn tend to have sold their souls to some demonic plane and are evil as hell. No, nono. Surely not.~
@367  = ~But it is famous that magic in Amn is, well, a tricky subject, that is why I came here. To learn, to train. And landed right in the middle of the iron crisis and the rising tensions. Now, I am trying to make the best of it.~
@368  = ~I have no *intention* of crossing you, or anyone else. That's what I said. Or trying to say.~
@369  = ~Me, being from Amn! Rising tensions between the lands? Imminent war betwen Amn and Baldur's Gate? I don't want to give anyone the wrong impression why I am here.~
@370  = ~Er. Alright, now the news is spilled, I'll go back into line.~
@371  = ~Soooo... Seems we are rather good at being travel companions, what do you think?~ [c#ablank]
@372  = ~I'd even say we could become friends.~
@373  = ~I think so, yes.~
@374  = ~Are you nervous about something?~
@375  = ~This really makes you nervous, doesn't it?~
@376  = ~Is this supposed to be casual chitchat?~
@377  = ~If I ignore your rather pathetic magic skills, yes.~
@378  = ~F... Friends? Really? That - that is great! That you think that way, I mean.~
@379  = ~I think so, too!~
@380  = ~What, me? Nervous? Haha, why would *I* be... dang, you are right.~
@381  = ~What? No, er... yes, probably.~
@382  = ~Ouch.~
@383  = ~I... I am nervous about being a mage from Amn. I mean, *I* am not nervous to be one, but I am nervous about what you might think of it. Do you... do you have any more questions regarding my motives of being here?~
@384  = ~Why would I?~
@385  = ~Actually, yes.~
@386  = ~No, it's alright, Brandock. Relax.~
@387  = ~I'm already travelling with others from Amn, so there is really no need.~
@388  = ~No, because I know you are a spy.~
@389  = ~I couldn't care less about your motives, Brandock. Be a better mage in the future, and we will get along well.~
@390  = ~Ack! You just said that! You don't believe that, do you?~
@391  = ~You can ask me anything, anytime. Please - I really did not choose to have rising tensions between the lands to happen now when I have finally found the courage to come here, and I definitely do not want it to lead to any misunderstandings between me and my travel companions.~
@392  = ~So - if you have any questions, just shoot. With your questions, I mean, not an arrow or a bolt... I'm not babbling, am I? I'm babbling.~
@393  = ~Er, sure...~
@394  = ~What? Why would you *not*? I mean...~
@395  = ~I'll be quiet now.~
@396  = ~They ... they really didn't let you back into Candlekeep?~ [c#ablank]
@397  = ~That is what happened, yes.~
@398  = ~Isn't it horrible? I was standing there, and the Gatewarden who knew me since I was a toddler looked into my face and said 'nope, not without a valuable book, you won't'.~
@399  = ~I think so, but to be honest, I didn't even try.~
@400  = ~Really? May I ask why not?~
@401  = ~Gorion told me to go to the Friendly Arm Inn to meet friends there. It felt the natural thing to do what he said.~
@402  = ~Candlekeep didn't feel safe anymore. Gorion's rushed departure, the assassins, the ambush - I had the impression I should move on, not back.~
@403  = ~Gorion is dead, and I wanted to go adventuring.~
@404  = ~But why do you think they'd do that? It's ... cruel. Are they thoughtless or evil? Or maybe ... scared?~
@405  = ~I come from a place where books are more important than people, Brandock. I am not surprised they shut me out - not necessarily to protect themselves, but to protect the keep and the wisdom within it from the harm they think my presence will bring.~
@406  = ~It's a good question, actually. Maybe they relied on Gorion's opinion, but he's dead, so he can no longer protect me.~
@407  = ~Maybe they do not see me as belonging to Candlekeep, but to Gorion. So, from their perspective, Candlekeep is not my home.~
@408  = ~I was merely tolerated, Brandock. A nuisance they bore because of Gorion's influence. Now that he's dead, maybe they secretly accuse me of his death. I think they are quite happy I am no longer there. I seem to draw too much attention.~
@409  = ~Hm. I never thought of it that way. I always thought they are just so far away from reality they don't even notice how cruel it is.~
@410  = ~They didn't let me in because I didn't carry a valuable book.~
@411  = ~Erm, yes. Sure. That was the obvious reason. I see you don't want to talk about this further, so ... let's get on with things, yes?~
@412  = ~I understand.~
@413  = ~I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. Although you seem to cope quite well, I am sorry how you lost your home.~
@414  = ~They ... they really didn't let you back into Candlekeep with a valuable book!~
@415  = ~<CHARNAME>, I keep on thinking that you grew up where I yearned to be so desperately... I am talking about Candlekeep. Do you mind if we talk about it?~ [c#ablank]
@416  = ~No, as I already said, you can ask me anything you want.~
@417  = ~It's alright, just ask.~
@418  = ~I'd rather not talk about it.~
@419  = ~Thank you!~
@420  = ~I mean... to be honest I am not as thrilled to talk about it as I was before we found the remains of the book, but still - I haven't given up hope completely that one day, I might be able to get inside nonetheless. If I'll still dare to show my face there, that is.~
@421  = ~I have to admit that your story dampened my spirits about that place. That they'd apply the stupid book rule to you!~
@422  = ~That's not what I thought you'd ask about the place.~
@423  = ~Don't get me started about Ulraunt. He really doesn't like me.~
@424  = ~They were happy I was gone, I figure.~
@425  = ~I know.~
@426  = ~Oh dear. That doesn't sound good.~
@427  = ~I wanted to ask about the books - about the monks - about the wise mages residing there - if it is true that *everyone* has to get up at five in the morning, but somehow all I can think of is that apparently, the saying "not everything is gold that glitters" is also true for the greatest library in the lands. (sigh)~
@428  = ~There's still a lot of really great people around. I mean amiable ones.~
@429  = ~That is true, I guess.~
@430  = ~I am glad to hear it.~
@431  = ~I mean, it's not a stupid rule per se - it's probably the reason it *is* the greatest library - but it is if applied to someone grown up there. They can't make me believe they require the hunters and merchants who supply their food and goods supply a 10,000 gold book every time they return?!~
@432  = ~Well, *those* people probably didn't grow up there, so...~
@433  = ~Not if they don't want to starve, that is.~
@434  = ~No, definitely not!~
@435  = ~Then I'll leave you in peace.~
@436  = ~Ha! They'd change the rule to "something to eat to enter" rather quickly, I'd think!~
@437  = ~I like your sense of humor. And I envy you for being able to jest about this. Thank you!~
@438  = ~I hope you will be able to return one day, <CHARNAME>... Not only to "Candlekeep", but to your *home*.~
@439  = ~All the things we are achieving... but still no real clue as to who is chasing you. How are you, <CHARNAME>?~ [c#ablank]
@440  = ~I am not sure. It's all so overwhelming.~
@441  = ~I feel alright. I like adventuring, it seems.~
@442  = ~Devastated. I wish I could return home and just be safe.~
@443  = ~Eager and determined to get the one who did this to me!~
@444  = ~It surely must be!~
@445  = ~That's definitely a good thing!~
@446  = ~Oh, yes. I understand the sentiment.~
@447  = ~I keep on thinking... Maybe it is all connected? You know, someone chasing you, and Ulraunt closing Candlekeep to you. Maybe they suspect your presence to be a threat to the monastery.~
@448  = ~That would mean they know things I don't, because I have no clue.~
@449  = ~Duh, you figured that out by yourself? I think it is rather obvious.~
@450  = ~That makes a lot of sense. It wasn't a secret that there is a threat... I still can't get my head around the fact that it involves *me*.~
@451  = ~Let's not talk about this, Brandock.~
@452  = ~That's a frightening thought, indeed.~
@453  = ~Oh.~
@454  = ~But what if... What if you being Gorion's foster child was the reason for someone coming after you? I know there were assassins after the ambush, but maybe they worked with obsolete bounty notes, because they didn't know Gorion was already dead!~
@455  = ~I don't know, it sounded better a moment ago, when I turned the thought in my head.~
@456  = ~It's a thought, though. Still, I am going after the ones who killed Gorion, and then we'll see what they want from me!~
/* the following refers to Strref #2920 in BG:EE */
@457  = ~I don't know... "hand over your ward" sounded pretty specific to me, and not like it was meant just because I am connected to Gorion.~
@458  = ~But if it were about Gorion, he wouldn't have taken me with him! They killed Gorion because he protected me!~
@459  = ~I'd prefer we wouldn't speculate about this.~
@460  = ~Hmm.~
@461  = ~Whatever it will turn out to be, I will not shy away from this, <CHARNAME>. I am not the bravest, but I told you I'd stand with you, and I will keep my word!~
@462  = ~I was tempted once by magic whose power I would not have been able to control.~
@463  = ~(waves his arms) That man *attacked* us inside a tavern! And *no one* cares! I think I could use a drink. If only I would. Drink, I mean. (sigh).~ 

/* new for vbeta 4 */
@464  = ~Uh-oh, that doesn't sound good. But I guess we won't turn around now, will we?~
@465  = ~That was probably a good choice... Although I do admit I would have been tempted to know what the experiment was about.~

@476  = ~Wow, there is even readable books here still, although this one is rather profane. Well, I guess that's the reason it is still here, now that I think of it.~
@477  = ~This book could be enough to give peace to Master Ulcaster, though. We should definitely take this to him.~
@478  = ~There is some other snippets and book pieces here that I can make use of, but... all in all, this place is far better suited to study the humanoid anatomy in all various forms and... stages and... I'd be very grateful if we'd leave this place again, soon.~
@479  = ~Master... Master Ulcaster? *The* Master Ulcaster is roaming the old school grounds? Gosh. Talk about feelings of obligation.~
@480  = ~Master Ulcaster wants us to give im a book from the old school, I think. Oh, we *so* should do this, <CHARNAME>. The sight breaks my heart.~
@481  = ~Rest in peace, Master Ulcaster. And do not worry. Even if this school is lost, there are others, and there are still students, ready and eager to learn! Oh, I really think this could be me someday, <CHARNAME>. Haunting the grounds and looking for my books. My books... where are my books... (ahem) Yep, sounds like me.~
/* #18300 in BG:EE */
@482  = ~... we all shall live again... someday...~

/* new for vbeta 6 */
@483  = ~No, Brandock. There were assassins *inside* Candlekeep I had to fight off as well. They were explicitely aiming at me, personally, stating that my head is worth a large amount of gold.~

/* new for vbeta 7 */
@484  = ~[Brandock to Sendai]Whoa! Did you consider that people walking so far north might, indeed, originate from Amn themselves?!~
@485  = ~[Brandock to Sendai]Whoa! And what makes you so sure that we are the ones travelling so far "north", maybe there is people here that originate from Amn... At least it's possible, hypothetically speaking, right?~
@486  = ~[Brandock to Sendai]This is a known name in Amn indeed, but... by the gods, woman, you cannot be serious.~
@487  = ~[Brandock to Sendai]Ugh. <CHARNAME>, I swear, not everyone on Amn is so... so... so *pompous*.~
@488  = ~[Brandock]This Prism... You know, the artist that rather died than leaving his work unfinished - he left me deeply impressed.~
@489  = ~[Brandock]Not in the positive sense. He was so driven... obsessed - crazy! He was so obsessed with his work that he lets it kill him!~
@490  = ~[PC reply]"Lets it kill him"? That's an interesting choice of words.~ 
@491  = ~[PC reply]He was sick, Brandock. No normal person would drive himself to death like that.~
@492  = ~[PC reply]A lot of people want to create something of value and perpetuity in their life. Often they are ready to die afterwards. He certainly did that.~
@493  = ~[PC reply]He finished his masterpiece and died happy. It's more than many others can say about their life.~
@494  = ~[Brandock]It's how I see it.~
@495  = ~[Brandock]He definitely was.~
@496  = ~[Brandock]Yes, but they usually also want to live long and happy before that!~
@497  = ~[Brandock]The question is what drove him into this insanity? How can a man become so obsessed with one goal? Is it a combination of special influences, or is it something that could happen to anyone?~
@498  = ~[PC reply]It definitely is a combination of circumstances. There is not many people who behave that way, they will always be an exception.~
@499  = ~[PC reply]I think it could happen to anyone, if a person sets his mind onto something too much.~
@500  = ~[PC reply]Why does this bother you so much?~
@501  = ~[PC reply]I don't want to talk about this futher, Brandock.~
@502  = ~[Brandock]That's what I'm afraid of.~
@503  = ~[Brandock]They surely are, still it happens.~
@504  = ~[Brandock]This... scares me. Seeing where having a very important personal goal could lead to if you are not careful how you pace it scares the wits out of me. I... I have very distinctive goals myself as a mage, as you know.~
@505  = ~[Brandock with restored book]Restoring the De Simplex Magicae is one of them, and a very strong one it is. Very, very strong. Scarily strong.~
@506  = ~[Brandock, with damaged book]*Somehow* making up for the De Simplex Magicae is one of them, and a very strong one it is. Very, very strong. Scarily strong.~
@507  = ~[Brandock]I am preparing myself to work on what I want to achieve for years to come, and not to let go before I reached it. How would I know where to take it slow - where to adapt to prevent going down the path Prism went? Will I be strong enough to be able to stop before it drives me mad - and dead?~
@508  = ~[PC reply]Of course you will be strong enough, Brandock. You strive for wisdom and want to do things right. You are not a driven madman that clings to a fantasy he made up in his mind.~
@509  = ~[PC reply]Having goals is a good thing, Brandock. They will guide you through the times where you question the meaning of life.~
@510  = ~[PC reply]How should I know?~
@511  = ~[PC reply]No worries. If I notice you going down that path I'll give you a good smack to put your head in order.~
@512  = ~[PC reply]How about you wory about these things if they are an actual danger?~
@513  = ~[PC reply]I couldn't care less, Brandock.~
@514  = ~[PC reply]It's good to be careful and always reevaluate one's ways of achieving one's goals, that is surely true.~
@515  = ~[Brandock]What? But... it might be too late then!~
@516  = ~[Brandock]Thank you. Your words give me reassurance.~
@517  = ~[Brandock]Oh yes, That's... that's very reassuring, thank you.~
@518  = ~[Brandock]I know it's probably too early to think about this - to *worry* about this. But what scares me is the possibility to lose track as to *when* it would be time to worry about it.~
@519  = ~[Brandock]I surely hope I'll never lose connection to reality like Mister Prism did.~
@520  = ~[Brandock]Of course the Iron Throne leaders would meet up in Candlekeep! From all places! Oh, *they* do not have a problem to give a book of high value each to get inside, do they? Of course not! (mumbles) Why do the bad guys always seem to have all the fun?~
@521  = ~[Brandock]Seeing that journal - Sarevok is a great liar, or a great schemer. Zhentarim, Chill, Blacktalon. I get a headache by even reading all these.~
@522  = ~[Brandock]And then there is that... incident including a half-ogre, after I cast magic on someone I didn't know anything about, ruining my reputation as a mage around these lands for time to come, and changing something inside me - changing me, *literally* - in a way I haven't yet understood...~
@523  = ~[Brandock]That... that *slime* was a person once...~
@524  = ~And from what it hinted at he was in - in Candlekeep? What else could it have meant?~
@525  = ~A mage, to be precise, and he... it was in Candlekeep. Why does *everybody* and their cow seem to get into Candlekeep?!~
@526  = ~To me it's also a little disturbing that its current form was a *wanted* change - and it really thought it was a good one...~
@527  = ~I though about something else when he said that: Hadn't we helped Alanna's suitor in Bergost - would he turned out to be such a talking slime, as well? Brrr...~
@528  = ~I think it's the other way around - what would Schlumpsha the Sewer King have said would he have seen a magically completely inept person turn into his favorite form!...~
@529  = ~Oh, you are right... Well, I guess it's too late now to see his reaction to that...~
@530  = ~Oh, I recognize a pair of my boots. I wasn't aware they needed repair. Please give them directly to my servant, he should be outside somewhere on the manor premises. He will also pay you for your sevices. Good day to you.~
@531  = ~Wow. Could I have a little bit of your optimistic spirit, please? I thin slice would do, I'd probably feed off it for months.~
@532  = ~Heh, if that'd be possible I'd have sliced it all up for Torlo over there already probably, 'm afraid. Nothing can do - only suggest you let the sun shine onto your face whenever possible, that's the only useful advice I can give you, and it's for free!~
@533  = ~Oh, we have the book Master Elvenhair is looking for! That's... an intersting read. "Cursed with misfortune for the rest of his or her days", hmm? That would explain a lot... Anyway, if we could spare this we should bring it to your old friend.~
@534  = ~And... I already *have* an unwanted form I am in danger of changing into! I have no interest in adding to the count. And I was thinking... What if I am in halfoger form when the lycantrophy kicks in, would I be a halfoger-werewolf?~
@535  = ~Wait! Bloodshed is not necessary. You are outnumbered, do you not have any survival instict? We will leave instantly, noone has to d...~
@536  = ~Too late. I was hired for one purpose, and I will fulfill it.~
@537  = ~What? Did everyone lose their minds in this house? We just defeated your b...~
@538  = ~Stop talking and defend yourself!~
@539  = ~What? This would be the Ice Island... *the* trap for teleporting mages?!~
@540  = ~And now we are here as a punishment for killing three young women... Yes, that *is* fate alright.~
@541  = ~And now we are here... send just because someone didn't like out demeanor. What a fate!~
@542  = ~I need to have a look at that wardstone again, now that I know what it is *for*... No, I don't really see how it works.~
@543  = ~(moans) Let's hope that crazy man wants his cloak back bad enough then... and that it won't be the only thing he brings back from here! Excuse me, <CHARNAME>, I feel like I need to throw up...~

@544  = ~[Gazib]Thank you, sir! You're the first today who actually cares. Er, maybe you should step away a bit...~
@545  = ~[Brandock]Well, I guess using a cursed scroll of Foolishness would be a very impressive experience, although one I would rather avoid! You can't call this scroll of "wisdom" - unless you want to mislead people, of course.~
@546  = ~[Brandock]Oh, yes. This raises bad memories. Very bad memories. Well, not only bad. But I know how you feel... Here, have some coins, friend.~
@547  = ~[Brandock]Oh, I *feel* strong as a half-ogre, but - no. Look at these walls. They are build to keep much stronger prisoners in.~
@548  = ~[Brandock]We still have Balduran's Logbook. Any idea what we will do with it?~
@549  = ~[Brandock](ack) I know I deserve this... Keep it coming... But yes, that's what's my book case is for.~
@550  = ~[Brandock]It's definitely a treasure. The logbook from the founder of Baldur's Gate! I hope we'll find a suitable place for it.~
@551  = ~[PC Reply]I thought we leave it with you, since it worked so well last time.~
@552  = ~[PC Reply]I think I will keep it, for now. It might open the way to Candlekeep at some point, who knows.~
@553  = ~[PC Reply]I want it to be in Candlekeep, it's the only place for such a book. I'll see when I'll be able to get it there.~
@554  = ~[PC Reply]Just leave it where it is for now. I'll deal with it later.~
@555  = ~[PC Reply]I think I will keep it, for now.~
@556  = ~[PC Reply]Well, Aldeth offered to buy it, and I think it's worth a thought.~
@557  = ~[Brandock]<CHARNAME>, I said I'll understand if we take our time to retreave my possessions, but I am getting nervous, and anxious, and - yes, I admit I'm getting impatient. Please let us return to Lion's Way and face whatever awaits in that cave - and in front of it, and around it, and... please let us go there soon. It's really important to me.~
@558  = ~[Brandock]<CHARNAME>, I have full understanding if you don't want to take the time to retrieve my possessions, although I'd hope you would tell me so honestly. I really need to get my things - or what is left of them. Do I go and try to find help elsewhere?~
@559  = ~[PC Reply]I'm sorry it took so long, Brandock, but we are kind of caught up in something currently. We'll go there as soon as possible, I promise.~
@560  = ~[PC Reply]Woops, completely forgot about that. Of course we'll head there right away.~
@561  = ~[PC Reply]Yes, go and look for help elsewhere, Brandock. Having you here doesn't seem to work out.~
@562  = ~[Brandock]Thank you! You can't imagine how relieved I am to hear that.~
@563  = ~[Brandock]Thank you for being honest. Although I would have hoped you'd tell me sooner.~
@564  = ~[Brandock]I... I can't postbone this any longer, I'll go now and retrieve my posessions on my own, or at least I'll try. I did enjoy travelling with you - except for the detail that you didn't keep your promise, of course.~
@565  = ~[Brandock]Fare well.~

@652  = ~Does it look like I did?~
@653  = ~This is none of your business.~
@654  = ~Whether you knew it is none of my business, indeed. But knowing who I'm travelling with is of high interest to me, and not only because of selfish reasons.~
@655  = ~No, you definitely did not.~
@656  = ~I'm guessing this is not what you expected to hear about your real parents?~
@657  = ~I couldn't help but overhear the chanters outside, singing about Alaundo's Prophecies about the children of Bhaal spreading chaos and destruction in their search of their father's power.~
@658  = ~I see why this knowledge may stir fear in people and increase their interest in you. Bhaal may be dead, but some power is tinkering with you in your dreams and granting you these abilities. We came to Candlekeep to investigate and I think we just found a big piece of the puzzle about what is happening to you. I'm just not sure how to read it all yet.~
@659  = ~So, you are a child of Bhaal, Gorion knew, he died defending you against one of your power-hungry "brothers", which you defeated - and I should probably not talk like this if all I wanted to ask was: how are you, <CHARNAME>?~ [c#ablank]
@660  = ~As well as can be expected.~

@664  = ~"As well as can be expected" means not well, at least where I come from.~
@665  = ~No, really, I am doing fine.~
@666  = ~And with me, it means what it says: I am well, as well as can be expected after being kicked out of my home, having witnessed my father being murdered, being chased through the lands, and having confronted a foe who set half the land in motion to gain power and killing me in the process - who, on top of it all, is my "brother" in godly heritage which I didn't know anything about until he more or less told me to my face.~

@672  = ~Thank you!~
@673  = ~I understand - we all do, I think. It was much to take in.~
@674  = ~I am fine, Brandock. I'm not in shock or anything, just not finished wrapping my head around all the things that happened.~
@675  = ~Much indeed - being kicked out of my home, having witnessed my father being murdered, being chased through the lands, and having confronted a foe who set half the land in motion to gain power and killing me in the process - who, on top of it all, is my "brother" in godly heritage which I didn't know anything about until he told me to my face.~
@676  = ~I am glad to hear it. I am not sure I would be.~
@677  = ~When my magic talent was discovered, I thought it to be a life changing, destiny shaping, everything else-overshadowing revelation... I hope this doesn't sound like I would compare the revelation of my magic talent with your heritage to the god of murder. I absolutely don't.~
@678  = ~That was the essence of my babbling: That it is not comparable, because what you are experiencing is really life changing, destiny shaping, and everything-else-overshadowing. Although I would like to point out that being a mage in Amn is sometimes a synonym for having a contagious, lethal disease, or at least, being very, very much near living as an outcast, if you get the chance to live long at all. But it doesn't change your status as a mortal... *This* is really big. You have my sympathy, <CHARNAME>!~
@679  = ~Understood. Still, you have my sympathy, <CHARNAME>. Getting to know that you are not the normal mortal you thought you were is really big.~
@680  = ~<CHARNAME>, you asked me recently whether I am scared of you because of your Bhaal heritage. I said I am not, and I meant it.~ [c#ablank]
@681  = ~<CHARNAME>, just in case this is not clear, I am not scared of you because of your Bhaal heritage.~ [c#ablank]
@682  = ~What *does* scare me, though, is what happens to you *because* of your heritage. All those people chasing you ... killing your foster father ... If that comes with being a child of Bhaal, then it scares me very much.~
@683  = ~It scares me too, to be honest.~
@684  = ~Don't forget the powers gained by dreaming, and an unusual interest by a strange old man in a wizard hat named Elminster...~
@685  = ~There are a lot of people experiencing similar things without such a "good" explanation... I guess.~
@686  = ~Considering there is almost nothing that does not scare you I don't see anything special.~
@687  = ~I can imagine.~
@688  = ~I can't change it, I'm afraid.~
@689  = ~That's... that's exactly what I wanted to say next!~
@690  = ~... I didn't list all those, yes.~
@691  = ~Ouch.~
@692  = ~I really don't know whether it makes any sense, but I am ... relieved there is such an explanation for the things happening to you. Knowing it's your Bhaal heritage that is drawing all this hostile attention. It does make sense, you know? It is ... less scary, if looked at it like that. At least for me.~

@752  = ~Master Elvenhair, we came here with a request of, erm, well I would say it is important but that is dependent of perspective, of course, and... ah, blast it! (Brandock takes out the remains of his book, mumbling something about "extremely sorry" and "foxes".)~ [c#ablank]
@753  = ~Oh, this is very unfortunate. The poor book! Foxes, you say? (murmurs) I think I should talk to Tethtoril about extending the protection spells... (clears his throat) So you want to work on restoring this, I figure?~

@755  = ~A seal from Purgan from Riatavin, signed with the signet of Alisarhold! Young friend, if Purgan from Alisarhold thought you ready and worthy to find entrance to Candlekeep, then this is enough for me to help you with your studies. Do not thank me too soon, young friend.~
@756  = ~I have some requirements for you to fulfill before we start working on the book snippets. I want you to collect the following items: a potion of regeneration, ink of an octopus - you usually can buy this from fishermen as they know mages need it occasionally, but it is expensive. Milking an octopus will do just as well, and if you ever went through the hassle of retrieving ink from an octopus yourself you will value the ink more I can tell you - and a Star Sapphire.~
@757  = ~Thank you... thank you, Master Elvenhair.~
@758  = ~What... what just happened? Why is this a book now? Where did this book come from?~ [c#ablank]
@759  = ~Always needed for the right consistency of magical ink.~
@760  = ~You've... *got* to be kidding me.~
@761  = ~This is most fascinating, it seems this transformation is related to the simplified magic formulas characterizing the De Simplex Magicae. We just raised the book to its next level, and a lot could be learnt from that. You need to find a way into Candlekeep with this, young friend. Unfortunately, it is not valuable enough in its current state, but it will be a most precious object of study. If you ever earn the way into Candlekeep, I will make sure the sages know about this.~
@762  = ~A potion of Regeneration!~
@763  = ~Thank you, Master Elvenhair. I don't know what to say... <CHARNAME>, I... I need to process what just happened. My head feels like it's gonna *explode*.~

@767  = ~I did notice, Brandock, I was standing like four feet away when it came to pass.~

@779  = ~Great, now we can go back to do important things.~
@780  = ~But I definitely am in such a phase! Or did you understand what happened?~
@781  = ~It-it turned into a whole book - I mean a book in whole - I mean a real book, with cover and pages, not "whole" in the sense of "everything is inside". By itself! From those snippets and pieces I recovered from the fox hole. Because of a preservation spell!~
@782  = ~You really think the creators of that book put such a spell on it on purpose?~
@783  = ~I know, Brandock, I was there when it happened.~
@784  = ~I'm sorry, I'm still trying to process what happened.~
@785  = ~What else could it be? Yes, I believe they did. The spells have to be added back by a mage of high enough expertise, and the gods know what it said about Oghma's wisdom... But of course we will only know for sure once I have the chance to study it thoroughly. With which Master Elvenhair will help me by bringing his Ruathlek lexicon from Candlekeep... Candlekeep!~
@786  = ~Master Elvenhair would even welcome me in Candlekeep with this book to study. He said that, didn't he? You heard it too?~
@787  = ~Yes, he definitely was most fascinated by the whole thing.~

@789  = ~Now all that you still need is another valuable book to enter, I guess.~

@791  = ~I can't believe how fate turned. It-it *did* turn, didn't it? Something good came out of this, this *mess*. I feel blessed and cursed at the same time, <CHARNAME>. Cursed, because I will remain the laughing stock of every mage out there, but blessed because it gave me the opportunity to not only restore the original magic spells the book contained, but also to discover unknown protection spells the creators put onto it.~
@792  = ~But, oh no, I will not start to think I *achieved* anything with what happened. It will be a fine specimen for examination, and maybe no one would have found out if it wouldn't have happened, but... No, I will never pretend it was a great achievement to have it destroyed first.~
@793  = ~I understand what you mean.~
@794  = ~Still, it's true. Protected in the high halls of some monastery, no one would have discovered that secret.~

@815  = ~I am very sorry, Brandock.~
@816  = ~Yeah, me neither.~
@817  = ~There is quite a bit happening around you I can't believe is happening.~
@818  = ~Which book was it?~
@819  = ~Spare me any self-pity, please.~
@820  = ~Your comfort is... not existing. But I guess I deserve it.~
@821  = ~Me neither, <CHARNAME>...~
@822  = ~Thank you. I appreciate your attempt to comfort me.~
@823  = ~I'm not even sure what to say. I don't even know what to *think*.~
@824  = ~What, you mean you didn't recognize it when I picked it up? (scoffs unhappily)~
@825  = ~Do you know which book that was?~
@826  = ~Tell me.~
@827  = ~Should I?~
@828  = ~No, because the first time I saw it, it wasn't really recognizable, was it?~
@829  = ~You know I don't.~
@830  = ~Brandock - enough. We can't change what happened. Focus on our tasks.~
@831  = ~It was the "De Simplex Magicae". It was a book about very complex spells, but explained in a way that it made it easy to cast them, even if the caster had a lower level skill. It was a *very valuable* book, and also of high historical value.~
@832  = ~Sounds like a powerful book, too.~
@833  = ~I could have had use for such a book. A pity you let it be destroyed.~
@834  = ~Where did it come from?~
@835  = ~(scoffs unhappily) No, it wasn't.~
@836  = ~Hells yes, that it was.~
@837  = ~Yes, I... I destroyed it...~
@838  = ~Bowgentle wrote it! Apparently, it's a predecessor to Bowgentle's Book which he created in the School of Wonder, only 10 years before the school was destroyed. The "De Simplex Magicae" is probably a preliminary study by Bowgentle and some of his students, before he simplified some of the spells even further.~
@839  = ~All that knowledge! To have destroyed such knowledge... I don't think I can forgive myself for this. - I'll be the one going down in history as the destroyer of it... I destroyed... I destroyed "De Simplex Magicae"...~
@840  = ~No, you didn't, Brandock. The foxes did.~
@841  = ~We've been through this, Brandock. It wasn't you who did it.~
@842  = ~Yes, you did, but we can't change it now.~
@843  = ~Man up, Brandock! Mistakes happen.~
@844  = ~I... I really appreciate your attempts to comfort me.~
@845  = ~I think I'm still in shock. I'll shut up now, or I'll say the same things over, and over.~
@846  = ~I am dead. Not literally, of course, but as a mage. My plan to go to Candlekeep... I am dead.~ [c#ablank]
@847  = ~You mean if this new travels around, you'll lose reputation as a mage?~
@848  = ~What do you mean?~
@849  = ~There are other valuable books out there, Brandock.~
@850  = ~I'm sure it will work out somehow. Let's move on.~
@851  = ~You think I wouldn't?~
@852  = ~Of course, but that's not what I meant.~
@853  = ~Anyone destroying written knowledge will be excluded and banned from Candlekeep forever, that's their dogma. I destroyed Bowgentle's "De Simplex Magicae"... I wanted to study in Candlekeep, and now they will ban me... they have to, don't they?~
@854  = ~We already talked about this, and you know I think you don't know unless you try.~
@855  = ~Not necessarily. That dogma is for people that destroy written knowledge out of malice, which you didn't do.~
@856  = ~I know that rule, Brandock. You didn't destroy it.~
@857  = ~Hm, I forgot about that... that sounds bad indeed.~
@858  = ~What if they don't get to know?~
@859  = ~What if you make up for it somehow?~
@860  = ~What will you do?~
@861  = ~You are drowning in self-pity, Brandock.~
@862  = ~"The foxes did" yes, I know, but don't you agree it sounds like the weakest excuse ever?~
@863  = ~It does, doesn't it?~
@864  = ~As if I could hide such a knowledge!~
@865  = ~Why not? You had the book hidden so far.~
@866  = ~But how... how would I make up for a book like that. Best if *I* stay away from any precious book in the future... and donate my gold to those who are capable of writing such books. Every library, every monastery, every place of wise people need gold to be sustained, no? I could collect gold and give it away, to people wise enough to write books like the De Simplex Magicae. That's the only compensation I could think of... and it won't open the doors to Candlekeep for me.~
@867  = ~But not from everyone! There are people who know I have it.~
@868  = ~Right now, I just go from one moment to the next. I have absolutely no idea what I'll do. Maybe I could hide...~
@869  = ~No, I will not hide what I did. It happened; there is no way around it. I will not lie, and I will not hide myself... although I probably should...~
@870  = ~Yes, I'm drowning in self-pity, I admit that, but is it really all you can see here? Don't you care about the destroyed book at all?~
@871  = ~I'm sorry. I see it means a lot to you.~
@872  = ~In the end, it was just a book, Brandock.~
@873  = ~No. I care about whether this incident distracts my group's mage, and if so, whether I should look for someone else to fill the spot.~
@874  = ~I can't imagine what people will say if they hear about this. The person who left me the book, if I ever meet him again. Other mages, who knew the book. There is no way of 'I possess it, so I can do with it what I want'. Oh no, not with a book like that.~
@875  = ~I hope it tasted nice. And maybe, just maybe the gods will hear my curses and Beregost Manor will have a new fox fur carpet, sometime in the future. Yes. Aah, what a wonderful thought.~
@876  = ~Oh, I wished I could see it like that.~
@877  = ~I... I understand. I am quiet now.~
@878  = ~And I already shouted into your face why I think it's a really bad idea!~
@879  = ~I wanted the book to be safe. I took it all the way to Alisarhold because I knew it's not in good hands with me. I only learned there *how* valuable of a book that was, but still.~ [c#ablank]
@880  = ~Alisarhold?~
@881  = ~Ah, Alisarhold, the Amnian library in the Snowflake Mountains.~
@882  = ~You were in Alisarhold? Then why coming to Candlekeep?~
@883  = ~Still don't want to hear about your self-pity.~
@884  = ~(moans)~
@885  = ~Sorry, Alisarhold is the greatest Amnian library, it's located in the Snowflake Mountains, which are east to the Shilmista forest.~
@886  = ~Exactly that one.~
@887  = ~Because Alisarhold is Cowled Wizards' territory, and I wanted to leave it. And because I needed a book of such value to get entry to Candlekeep. Because they said it's my right to take it... I can tell you all about it later. After I'll wake up from this nightmare... This is a dream, right?~
@888  = ~We even put a tracking ward onto the book. And they gave me an enchanted book case. Protected so no one but me could take out the book, and so that it would stay with me as long as the book is inside, and... And I fell *asleep* with the book out of the book case... *And* the foxes got to it, and... (Brandock's voice trails away.)~ [c#ablank]
@889  = ~I am really sorry, Brandock. I wished I could help you in some way.~
@890  = ~There is always things one doesn't anticipate, and sometimes they are fatal.~
@891  = ~At least you accept now that it was the foxes who did the actual destruction. I'd say you are one step further in coping with this, Brandock.~
@892  = ~Cope with this in silence, I don't want to hear it.~
@893  = ~This is not even a good story. I mean seriously, if you'd hear this being told as a story, would you think it's a good, believable, intriguing one? I wouldn't. *Way* too much drama. And ridiculous, outright pathetic, that's all that it is.~
@894  = ~I'm trying to!~
@895  = ~The only reason I had the book on my lap and not inside the case when falling asleep is because I read it every free minute I could spare. That is how much I valued it... (moans)~ [c#ablank]
@896  = ~I can only imagine how much you're missing it now that it's gone.~
@897  = ~Loved to death, so to say.~
@898  = ~Your mistake was travelling alone.~
@899  = ~Brandock, cope in silence, please.~
@900  = ~That's actually quite funny, but I don't feel like laughing currently.~
@901  = ~Definitely, and I won't do that mistake again!~
@902  = ~I even tried to copy the book, but that was before I left for Alisarhold and before I had any experience in it, so my attempt to replicate its magic caused my scroll to burst into flames, and with it all my writing utensils, and half of my parents' table. It's *the* table of my parents. They only have one. But as I said, that was before I was taught the basics on how to do something like this...~
@903  = ~I *want* to do magic. I want to learn, I want to be able to control it, but foremost, I want to *learn* about it! And now... now I don't dare touch such a book again, of fear it might happen again!~
@904  = ~You are by far the person most interested in magic and wisdom I have met since leaving Candlekeep.~
@905  = ~This can't be your solution to this.~
@906  = ~Do you see such a book here? I don't, so what's the problem?~
@907  = ~Don't you think you are overreacting just a little tiny bit?~
@908  = ~But how... how am I to overcome this... this shock? Should I search for a teacher... a powerful wizard who will watch over me. Or should I stay away from such precious books for the rest of my life?~
@909  = ~How about something in between? "For the rest of your life" is quite a long time.~
@910  = ~Brandock, is "having a powerful wizard as a teacher" an option currently? I don't think so.~
@911  = ~How about sleeping on it a couple of more nights, Brandock. You are still quite devastated, that is never a good time to make decisions.~
@912  = ~I know I am overreacting, <CHARNAME>, it's how I am! I am still trying to process what happened and how to deal with it.~
@913  = ~But it won't stay that way in my life forever, or at least I surely hope so!~
@914  = ~Why am I thinking about this, anyway! I will be banned from Candlekeep and rejected by any mage who has a name and cares about their reputation. Let's move on, <CHARNAME>, your weak excuse for a mage is ready to be at your service.~
@915  = ~(Brandock takes a deep breath.) I'll learn to live with it, and someday, I'll also learn not to talk about my turmoil. This will still take a while, I'm afraid.~
@916  = ~I... I can't leave it at that. Fine, so I will be expelled and rejected by any mage or monastery who has an interest in keeping their good reputation... But I can't switch off that head of mine, <CHARNAME>. I can't stop my memories of spells and wise things I read and heard going round and round in it, and I can't stop the magic pouring out of my hands... well, alright, I *could* stop the latter, but I don't want to!~ [c#ablank]
@917  = ~And foremost... those stupid spells out of the "De Simplex Magicae"! They are in my head, telling me to write them down...~
@918  = ~Are you saying you know the spells by heart?~
@919  = ~Do I have to listen to this?~
@920  = ~As I said, I read that book every spare minute. I didn't only read it. I wanted to know that book inside out. I am not sure why, it felt as if it was my obligation... Funny, now that I think of it. As if I'd known I would lose it. Which I only did because I studied it like a berserker. If the gods think this is funny I tend to differ strongly.~
@921  = ~I have all the memories of the spells in my head. I always seemed to be able to remember some things with unusual accuracy, my official Cowled Wizard teacher truely hated me for it.~
@922  = ~I have all the memories of the spells in my head. I *was* able to cast one of its spells from my memory and Master Thalantyr recognized it instantly.~
@923  = ~Maybe... maybe my doom could turn into my blessing? Like, if I'd find a kind, wise mage who would help me rewrite the book, or at least parts of it, then having lost it while learning to write one myself wouldn't be so pointless? With some pages still readable and some to a certain extent, an experienced sage should be able to recreate most spells in that book when I tell him what I remember, no?~
@924  = ~Definitely. This sounds like a good plan.~
@925  = ~Do you have someone specific in mind?~
@926  = ~Finally, an occupation you can do in silence. Terrific! Go and do that. And leave me alone with it.~
@927  = ~No, I wouldn't know who would be ready to work with me on this. And I seriously doubt anyone would be willing to. Work on this with *me*, I mean.~
@928  = ~I will start right away. Not a magic scroll, don't worry. But I will note down the recipes I remember. So, when I'll find a wise mage who'll help me with this then I'll be prepared... In 50 years or so.~
@929  = ~No, you don't. But know that I am determined to write down all recipes from "De Simplex Magicae" I can still remember.~
@930  = ~(Something made you stir at night. You see Brandock - fallen asleep with his book on his lap.)~ [c#ablank]
@931  = ~Shh, Brandock! Wake up!~
@932  = ~Er, Brandock? Waiting for some foxes again?~
@933  = ~(You gently remove the book from his lap and stow it away.)~
@934  = ~(You decide that you don't care.)~
@935  = ~(Brandock shuffles slightly in his sleep, but his breathing remains deep and steady.)~
@936  = ~(Brandock sleeps on, unaware of his surroundings.)~
@937  = ~(Brandock gets up when you are already awake. You notice him pause for a short moment, then he shuffles through his bag hectically. Obviously finding what he was looking for, he exhales audibly, before pausing one more time.)~ [c#ablank]
@938  = ~Er... <CHARNAME>? I don't remember putting the book into my backpack yesterday evening. Do you know who saved me...?~
@939  = ~(Smile) It was me this time.~
@940  = ~You really should have learned something last time this happened, I would think.~
@941  = ~You mean you don't remember the five mugs of ale, either?~
@942  = ~Oh no, I'm not falling for that. I don't remember drinking any... (He pauses.) I mean, I would not *do* that. I think.~
@943  = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. Thank you - thank you *so* much. I owe you. Maybe not my life, but my sanity, my credibility as a mage - as much as there still is of it - and my peacefulness against smaller mammals.~
@944  = ~(Brandock awakes after you. He blinks a few times, then jumps up halfway, nearly dropping the book. He manages to catch it before it falls down, making several hectic movements of questionable acrobatics.)~ [c#ablank]
@945  = ~By the mercy of... GODS... The nine hells! I... I fell asleep with a book on my lab. Again. Oh the mercy of the gods. And it is still here. It is still here...~
@946  = ~(He stows the book away, with what seems to be slightly trembling hands.)~
@947  = ~Hello there! Could I interest you in anything I caught today?~
@948  = ~Yes, please show us your wares.~
@949  = ~No, thank you.~
@950  = ~Have a good day then.~

/* new for vbeta 4 */
@951  = ~Now with Sarevok dead and all... Wow, I can't even start to realize what this means. Tension between Amn and the Sword Coast should decrease, hopefully, and there should be proper iron around again. And you will finally have some peace, I hope.~
@952  = ~Definitely. I feel much more at ease already.~
@953  = ~I haven't fully grasped that the threat from Sarevok is gone yet.~
@954  = ~There is no peace for me. There will be always something to do.~
@955  = ~Peace? With the knowledge of who my real father was? Pffft.~
@956  = ~Whatever, Brandock.~
@957  = ~What I meant was peace from the things that are settled now... No one can take those away from you. I hope.~
@958  = ~Yes, I can imagine. To have a goal and to strive for it for so long, and then it's done and one needs time to readjust to the new situation.~
@959  = ~Well... Yes, I agree that this knowledge will keep you occupied. I am sorry, <CHARNAME>.~
@960  = ~That is great to hear!~
@961  = ~So, what will you do now?~
@962  = ~Well, right now we should return to the Palace and report back to the Dukes, I guess. After that - we will see.~
@963  = ~I'll just go on and see what the gods might have in stock for me.~
@964  = ~There are still some things that need our attention. I'll just continue with all the tasks we collected along the way.~
@965  = ~I think it's about time we'll go into a nice inn and take the evening off. If not now, then when?~
@966  = ~I have the uneasy feeling that my plans do not matter, because the gods will have their own plans for me.~
@967  = ~(sigh) Yes, I can relate to that feeling, actually. But still, it's our responsibility to shape the time that is given to us.~
@968  = ~Right you are! Life and its duties will catch up with us soon enough.~
@969  = ~That sounds reasonable.~
@970  = ~I will remain at your side until we finished all the loose ends and bits. I always thought I'd remain with you until we found the murderer of Gorion, but parting now would not feel right - if you want me to stay, that is. I need some time to realize it's done... And to collect the needed courage to return home.~

/* new for vbeta7 */
@971  = ~This was a most interesting experience for me at my age, young man. Please, continue to note down what you remember from the book's spells as you already did. Until we know exactly what the first pages translate to we should not risk the recipes getting lost.~
@972  = ~But we cannot know when this will come to pass, and I am much too intrigued to wait for it to happen. I will do the following, my young mage. Next time my ways guide me to Candlekeep, I will bring my Ruathlek lexicon with me. I do not know yet when this will be, I fear it will be a while still. I will let you know once this happens.~
@973  = ~Until then we would be poorly advised to just try and do anything more with the book before we do not know what exactly it says how to proceed to restore it. Do not attempt to write spells into it on your own account, Brandock. I fear for you safety.~
@974  = ~[Brandock]I would never, Master Elvenhair. I know how dangerous it can be, ahem. Thank you - thank you so much for all your help. I am completely stunned and don't know what to say.~
@975  = ~Er, yes, it was my hope you would help me with it... or let me help you with it, to be more precise... Master Elvenhair, I cannot say how grateful I am that you call this whole incident "unfortunate" and nothing else! Would I be you, I'd call it by much more drastic words, I can tell you that.~
@976  = ~I... I do not come to you with such a request without any proof of my abilities, Master Elvenhair. See this seal - it would have granted me access to Candlekeep as a seeker, had I the book still with me.~
@977  = ~Also, I want you to note down anything you can still remember about the spell recipes that were in the books. Not as a scroll - that would be way too dangerous. Just plain notes on paper.~
@978  = ~Once you'll retrieve all the ingredients we will first stabilize the book pages before we attempt anything else and I will see how you fare with scroll scribing. Only after that and when I see what you still remember from the book's spells we will work on restoring the book.~
@979  = ~My time is scarce and I have many obligations, but I understood you are travelling with young <CHARNAME> now, so when we will find time to work on this now and again it will suffice, hm? This is nothing one can accomplish in a tenday. This will keep you busy for years, my young friend, and you will continue to work on it long after I've taught you everything you need to know to work on it.~
@980  = ~Oh, I didn't expect this to happen. Hmm... Seems the creator of this book included a precautionary enchantment should it be damaged - the enchantment on the destroyed book latched onto our attempts to restore it and transformed back into a book.~ 
@981  = ~But only with empty pages - maybe because it was heavily damaged. Hmm... The spells need to be added back by a mage of high enough expertise... and it also seems to mention Oghma's wisdom. At least I *think* this is what the text is saying, but my Ruathlek is not the best. To understand it properly I'd need my lexicon, which is in Candlekeep.~
@982  = ~But I do recommend you practice your scroll scribing skills so you are prepared for scribing spells into the De Simplex Magicae later. Just come here to me to do so. I'll supervise your first tries.~
@983  = ~A powerful magic, and useful in more than one way if you know how.~
@984  = ~A Star Saphire.~
@985  = ~Always a sight for sore eyes.~
@986  = ~Come back when you have all needed ingredients.~
@987  = ~Let us begin with preserving the remaining book snippets against further destruction, shall we?~
@988  = ~And on top of it all, Master Elvenhair offered me to train scroll scribing with him. I'd be ready to take him up on that offer any time you can spare a moment, <CHARNAME>. I would be daft not to!~
@989  = ~Albeit not today any more, of course.~
@990  = ~Please, <CHARNAME>, let us return to Master Elvenhair as soon as possible!~
@991  = ~Having our names cleared takes a huge weight from my shoulders.~
@992  = ~Oh yes, I can very much relate to that!~
@993  = ~Please let's hold on to them, until we can go to Master Elvenhair again.~
@994  = ~Now that we cleared our names, we probably can visit Elvenhair again, what do you think?~
@995  = ~[Elvenhair]Ah, young <CHARNAME> and <PRO_HISHER> friends. I am very unsettled to say so, but I cannot well be seen with people wanted for murder in Candlekeep. I am sorry. I do know that Tethtoril thinks you do not deserve this, and I trust his judgement, but until this is resolved, I need you to leave.~
@996  = ~The spells are gone? They... they're gone? And need to be rewritten... Not with too little experience... I'll... I will complete the book again! I swear upon my life!~
@997  = ~[Elvenhair]Ah, young <CHARNAME> and <PRO_HISHER> friends - it is good to see you. With great relieve I heard that the accusations against you were false indeed. I am sorry you were the target of such a misunderstanding and it eases my heart to know that you did not do wrong. Feel welcome in my house any time you wish.~
@998  = ~We... we understand, Master Elvenhair. You are alive and well - that is the most important thing right now and will hopefully stay that way. Er, I hope that didn't sound like a threat... <CHARNAME>, let us go, please.~
@999  = ~Thank you so much, Master Elvenhair. Let me stress that I am more than relieved to see you alive and well as well. We killed a doppelganger with your face in Candlekeep!~
@1000  = ~Yes, Tethtoril wrote to me about doppelgangers inside the keep - nasty, very nasty.~
@1001  = ~[Messenger]Mister Brandock Deepwater? I have a message from Master Elvenhair in Beregost. He wants me to tell you that he is ready to help you again.~
@1002  = ~That - that is fantastic! Thank you, good man, for coming all the way to letting me know. Here, take these coins. <CHARNAME>, I guess you know what I'll beg for next - let us return to Master Elvenhair as soon as our tasks will allow!~
@1003  = ~[Elvenhair]So, young Brandock. I have here my Ruathlek lexicon, and am ready to translate the note in the De Simplex Magicae with you. Shall we?~
@1004  = ~[Brandock]Oooh - yes, please!~
@1005  = ~[Brandock]Master Elvenhair, I was in Candlekeep - but we got kicked out - which you already know. I was so devastated!~
@1006  = ~[Elvenhair]Yes, this was a most unfortunate affair. But at least your names are cleared now, so do not worry, young mage. If your steps will guide you to Candlekeep again in the future, you will find entry as a seeker again.~
@1007  = ~[Elvenhair]So, let me see the book. This shouldn't take too long. I already prepared everything we need.~
@1008  = ~[Elvenhair]"...Oghma's Wisdom". That's it, my young Brandock.~
@1009  = ~(Brandock reads the translated notes.) "So, whoever of you fools damaged the book, you found out that a preservation spell makes the book physically whole again. I expect you to make detailed notes about the process, as I want to expand this spell as a way of preserving magical books in whole. So far it only restores the blank pages. Let it be a lesson to you to take better care of magic books in the future. I expect you to fill the pages with spells again - they should continue to benefit from the magic of the book and should be effective accordingly without cost. But let me tell you: this will be a long road for you, because wih your current experience you don't even need to try. And before you do anything, make sure you seek Oghma's wisdom."~
@1010  = ~This... this is a note to one of Bowgentle's apprentices! Seems he never damaged the book, contrary to his master's expectations. It took me to do that - ahem... That's what Bowgentle was researching? A spell that preserves magical books so that they are restored with a preservation spell?~
@1011  = ~"Oghma's Wisdom". I do not know yet whether this refers to an item, a spell - or just what the name says: wisdom hold by those who worship Oghma. But I already know where I will find an answer to this riddle. The greatest temple of Oghma I know is in my home land, in Athkatla.~
@1012  = ~<CHARNAME> - this book and any notes I'll write about the spells in it will accompany my until I'll return home. Thank you, Master Elvenhair, for your help in this. I am in your debt.~
@1013  = ~[Elvenhair]It is most fotunate to see that this great book will indeed be restored. But the greatest knowledge out of this book is the magics that has the potential to preserve the contents even beyond the book's destruction. This knowledge will be most valuable to any sage in these realms. Let me know about your progress, young Brandock, so I can share the wisdom with the wise sages in Candlekeep.~
@1014  = ~[Brandock]I will certainly do so, Master Elvenhair. I promise. Just as much as I promise to restore the De Simplex Magicae, even if Oghma's priests will need to extract my brain to get the spell recipes out for restoration.~
@1015  = ~I did hear the title after Thalantyr helped you with your half-ogre problem, but I still don't know what it was.~
@1016  = ~[Brandock]So, to summarize. The De Simplex Magicae was destroyed - and yet, it wasn't, but transformed into a magic experiment, teaching book of a different kind. It wasn't meant to do that - or it was, with detailed instructions to... whomever about what to do with it afterwards. The whole restoration of the empty book was a prank - and at the same time a serious magical research project. I... my head is spinning.~
@1017  = ~That note is hilarious. Do you believe it was Bowgentle who wrote that?~
@1018  = ~What will you do now?~
@1019  = ~It gave you a clue what to do next! That's helpful.~
@1020  = ~[Brandock]This is not certain, just as it is not certain that the De Simplex Magicae is really by him - it could also be by one of his students. It would make sense with regard to the preservation magic in the book never getting investigated any further, though - I'm sure I'd lose track of some of my research projects after being stuck in a dog's body for several years, too. As much as I know of him, it would fit, though.~
@1021  = ~[Brandock]Indeed, it is.~
@1022  = ~So you'll continue to carry that empty book with you. That's great - it's not like we could use the space.~
@1023  = ~[Brandock]I will watch it as if my life depends on it until my way leads me back to Athkatla for the wisdom of the Temple of Oghma, as requested in what we think are Bowgentle's notes.~
@1024  = ~[Brandock]But after that I will search for someone talented enough to refill the pages with spells - and I doubt this will be me, <CHARNAME>. I will continue to make notes of what I remember from the spell recipes - what made them so special that even an unexperienced wizard can cast them, but I start to understand now that most of the magic was inside the book itself. No wonder I couldn't write the spells onto a scroll...~
@1025  = ~[Brandock]Let us continue our travels. I have a goal now - sort of, it's more like the next milestone. I admit that I appreciate that it leaves me in a state where I know exactly what my next step will be without having the chance to do it right away, giving me some sort of break from this... this extremely fascinating nightmare.~
@1026  = ~Something else - after witnessing what happened to the De Simplx Magicae when Master Elvenhair cast the preservation spell I think I have an idea what to do with cursed scrolls to rewrite the magic inside to something useful - I just need more experience before I can actually try.~
@1027  = ~I can't express how thankful I am that you reached out to me so quickly!~

@1050 = ~Gatewarden, would you have a look at the book remains my friend carries. It was a very valuable book, and a lot of it is readable still. Would this suffice to get entrance?~
@1051 = ~Gatewarden, would you have a look at the book my friend carries. It is a magic book of great historical value. Would this suffice to get entrance?~
@1052 = ~P... please, <CHARNAME>... don't...~
@1053 = ~What snippets and pieces are you offering? No, this will not do as the entry fee! If you have nothing else to offer, I need you to leave.~
@1054 = ~<CHARNAME>, why did you do that? I know they will learn eventually, but... but... Fine, so I wasn't banned directly. But that was only because the Gatewarden does not know the true value of this book!~
@1055 = ~Well, I guess it was worth a try.~
@1056 = ~What are you offering me as an entrance gift, a book consisting of empty pages? No, this will not do as the entry fee! If you have nothing else to offer, I need you to leave.~
@1057 = ~<CHARNAME>, next time you try to give away my book, please ask me beforehand? Well, I guess it was worth a try.~
@1058 = ~C... Candlekeep? You are sending us to Candlekeep? You are sending us *into* Candlekeep? With a book valuable enough for the Gatewarden?~
@1059 = ~That's what I said, young man.~
@1060 = ~Oh - my - ... (Brandock stopps talking and just stands there, looking at the towers of Candlekeep, mouth open.)~ [c#ablank]
@1061 = ~You've never actually seen it, have you?~
@1062 = ~I agree it's quite impressive, now that I look at it from here.~
@1063 = ~You alright?~
@1064 = ~Great. If the walls from here already freeze your brain, then I don't want to know how we'll manage to actually approach the doors.~
@1065 = ~No, never.~
@1066 = ~It *is*, isn't it?~
@1067 = ~Oh yes, yes, I am alright.~
@1068 = ~Whut? Oh, yes, you are right.~
@1069 = ~Isn't it *marvelous*? This is by far the most impressive monastery I've ever seen. Well, what am I saying. It's Candlekeep!~
@1070 = ~You know I'm from Candlekeep, right? But I had to leave with Gorion, and now he's gone...~
@1071 = ~Let's move on.~
@1072 = ~Gods, <CHARNAME>, and here I am, gaping at Candlekeep's towers in the distance, while you lost your father, your home... I am sorry for your loss!~
@1073 = ~I am glad I can be of service. I really mean it.~
@1074 = ~Are we going to the gates?~
@1075 = ~Do you... do you think they'll open the doors for you again?~
@1076 = ~You're... you're not planning on showing the book remains, are you?...~
@1077 = ~Well... (sigh) The doors will remain closed to us, I am sure of that. At least in the near future...~
@1078 = ~And we are going there. To say I'm nervous is, well... a huge understatement.~
@1079 = ~Ah, I wished we'd found the time to go and see Master Elvenhair. I would feel *much* better knowing what awaits me once someone finds out about what happened to the De Simplex Magicae.~
@1080 = ~Promise me not to talk to *anyone* about the destroyed De Simplex Magicae, <CHARNAME>... Please!...~
@1081 = ~We are going to Candlekeep! We are going *into* Candlekeep!~ [c#ablank]
@1082 = ~Yes, we are, my friend!~
@1083 = ~So it seems.~
@1084 = ~We are going there on an official investigation, Brandock.~
@1085 = ~Brandock, I need you as a mage in this group. Promise you will not turn into a knowledge seeking zombie in there.~
@1086 = ~I... I promise I will behave in there, <CHARNAME>. Although I beg you, don't be too cruel on me once we are inside and I'll turn into an excited fool.~
@1087 = ~Of... of course. Although spending a *little* bit of time there would be alright, no? Like... one afternoon. A few hours. *One* hour!~
@1088 = ~Brandock, this is your chance. This book will give us entry, you have the needed seal and a gift to stay as a seeker.~
@1089 = ~(smiles) I am sure we could arrange for an extra hour or two while we investigate the place.~
@1090 = ~We'll see, Brandock.~
@1091 = ~Just like that...~
@1092 = ~That would be fabulous!~
@1093 = ~(sigh) This is all I ever wanted, entering Candlekeep. All I wanted and worked towards for months. And now, that it is so close... All I'd do in the tenday is working on the translation of the pages in Ruathlek in the De Simplex Magicae. I have no experience with the language so it would take me the whole time, I am sure. I wouldn't have the nerve to study anything else!~
@1094 = ~You really mean it? But what about your quest, what about my promise to support you? Candlekeep will stay right here and go nowhere... I guess.~
@1095 = ~Oh, I'll most definitely regret it. But this is not how I anticipated coming here...~
@1096 = ~I am sure he'll understand. He seemed quite interested in knowing what it says, too.~
@1097 = ~And now we are here, in front of these impressive walls.~
@1098 = ~And while it is a valid thing to do, I have Master Elvenhair's word that he'll help me translate it later. Surely he will understand that I feel obliged to accompany you? Candlekeep doesn't go anywhere, but I can't just abandon you and our tasks!~
@1099 = ~Are you sure you won't regret it later?~
@1100 = ~What about the people in the keep? Shouldn't we *warn* someone?~
//@1101 = ~~
//@1102 = ~~
@1103 = ~Because... I would abandon you and your search, <CHARNAME>... the Sword Coast, even! My home land, Amn, in the coming war! And all that just to study a book...~
@1104 = ~(moans) The gods really think this is funny, don't they? I'd have all I wanted, right here... but can't grab it without feeling bad!~
//@1105 = ~~
//@1106 = ~~
//@1107 = ~~
//@1108 = ~~
//@1109 = ~~
//@1110 = ~~
//@1111 = ~~

//@1116 = ~~
//@1117 = ~~

@1120 = ~That... was as awkward as my aunts Elly and March. I feel with you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1121 = ~Hm? Now, run along and play with your friends, yes?~
@1122 = ~Wait, what? That was a doppelganger! A doppelganger! They seem to show up everywhere the Iron Throne has their hands on. We have to warn the monks!~ [c#ablank]
@1123 = ~There were doppelgangers in the monastery! Do you know that? It wasn't the first time they turned up in the presence of the Iron Throne!~
@1124 = ~These are serious accusations, but I'll heed your warning, young friend.~
@1125 = ~Doppelgangers! All those doppelgangers... What is going on here, <CHARNAME>?~ [c#ablank]
@1126 = ~This is not what I thought. In the library I thought it's just some of the Iron Throne's pets they brought with them for protection, but this...~
@1127 = ~This looked like preparations for an invasion!~
@1128 = ~(sigh) This would have been a great ending, <CHARNAME>. It all being an illusion, Elminster and Gorion, taking us out of the horrors into a world without Iron Throne, without doppelgangers, where you would be still in Candlekeep...~ [c#ablank]
@1129 = ~And me still mourning over my lost possessions. Or... would *I* have been part of the illusion and doomed to remain here?... I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. I am sorry there was no easy way out.~
@1130 = ~At least we have a name... and maybe a face? "Koveras" - Sarevok. But what would he *want* from you? And why this masquerade? Why this setup? I mean I understand very well that it was to get you out of the way, and that Koveras-Sarevok obviously works with whoever murdered Gorion - but *why*?~
@1131 = ~...Expelled.~ [c#ablank]
@1132 = ~Brandock, I am so sorry you were caught in this.~
@1133 = ~I am shocked myself, Brandock.~
@1134 = ~Not now, Brandock. I have other problems than to listen to your whiny self-pity!~
@1135 = ~Oh, but I am not sorry, <CHARNAME>.~
@1136 = ~Self-pity?~
@1137 = ~I am angry! I am totally, absolutely, completely angry!~
@1138 = ~Yes, I can imagine. To lose what you wanted for so long...~
@1139 = ~Why?~
@1140 = ~I don't care with which emotions you respond to being expelled from Candlekeep. I don't have time to listen to your woes!~
@1141 = ~What? No, that's not the reason I'm angry.~
@1142 = ~I am angry because they accused you, and me, of things we did not *do*!~
@1143 = ~Yes, we killed the Iron Throne leaders - but it's not that they gave us much choice!~
@1144 = ~Someone surely wanted to put the blame on us.~
@1145 = ~We need to find out what is going on and clear our name!~
@1146 = ~I am furious, too. There is nothing we can do right now than find our way out of here.~
@1147 = ~That's not the reaction I expected from you.~
@1148 = ~Let's just find our way out of here, Brandock. I don't feel like talking.~
@1149 = ~Sure!~
@1150 = ~I am... glad I am here now, and not back up there. To stay, knowing you are accused of murder, not knowing what really happened, believing you to be executed the following day! I would be grief-stricken!~
@1151 = ~Also, to be honest - the situation as it was back there with all the people and *doppelgangers* bustling around, I don't think I'd have found much quietness for studying, anyway.~
@1152 = ~Also, to be honest - the situation as it was back there with all the people and bustling around and Iron Throne meetings in the inner keep, I don't think I'd have found much quietness for studying, anyway.~
@1153 = ~We will clear our names, and I will return here later - sometime in the future, when no Iron Throne leaders have meetings in these halls of wisdom and no war is hanging over the lands.~
@1154 = ~Wanted for murder! Because some... some someone gives a false testimony. And Ulraunt just... just sentences us to death. You know what? He is just like the Cowled Wizards I wanted to avoid! Ah, this does hit me as a shock, I have to admit...~
@1155 = ~I should have been warned, <CHARNAME>, after what you told me from this place and how they treated you after Gorion's death.~
@1156 = ~Candlekeep infiltrated by doppelgangers. I am so shocked I don't know what to say.~
@1157 = ~So many doppelgangers... and all pretending to be someone else. Someone you knew... It is said that doppelgangers can only impersonate someone they've killed. This would mean, that all the people they impersonated...~ [c#ablank]
@1158 = ~But no, there was also a duplicate of Gorion! We know he wasn't killed by doppelgangers... er, we do know that, yes?~
@1159 = ~Yes, I am pretty sure Elminster wasn't killed by the doppelganger we met down there.~
@1160 = ~I sure hope it doesn't mean that everyone we "saw" is dead.~
@1161 = ~This is a nightmare.~
@1162 = ~Was there anything we could have done?~
@1163 = ~I don't want to talk about this.~
@1164 = ~Indeed.~
@1165 = ~Well, we can't save the ones they already killed. And we walked the catacombs, there were no more living people, or we would have found them! But we killed all doppelgangers down in the catacombs.~
@1166 = ~You warned Tethtoril. I am sure they will look out for more of them.~
@1167 = ~We met Arkanis and Deder - they know! I am sure they will be warning the others.~
@1168 = ~Hm, after we went through the catacombs I don't have the impression there is much left that needs a warning against.~
@1169 = ~This is not my problem anymore.~
@1170 = ~Well, we did our best to stop them, even though we didn't know we are fighting a doppelganger invasion when we started. But to have to just walk away leaves me uneasy...~
@1171 = ~This is a very good thought, Brandock, and an important matter. I will give note to my brethren at next occasion. The Order of the Radiant Heart will know about the events in Candlekeep and see to the doppelgangers being defeated!~
@1172 = ~Well, make sure they'll have a valuable book with them if they try to get passage... (moans) Forgive me, that remark was tasteless. I thank you, Ajantis. This is very reassuring, and should be enough to resolve the matter.~
@1173 = ~(sigh) To know that Candlekeep was about to be infiltrated by doppelgangers! The mighty library... I need to ponder this, <CHARNAME>. And what this must mean to you, I can only guess!~
@1174 = ~But it was your home! Your remark gives me shivers down the spine, <CHARNAME>.~
@1175 = ~<CHARNAME>, how do you feel? I know there is much on your plate, currently. What I am referring to is what we experienced in Candlekeep. Your home, and not only did you have to leave it a wanted criminal, but saw it being invaded by doppelgangers... Your childhood friends, a lot of those people you knew - dead. Is there anything I can do for you?~ [c#ablank]
@1176 = ~I try to manage, Brandock. Thank you for caring.~
@1177 = ~Yes, just be here and be a friend. It helps a lot, already.~
@1178 = ~No, I am afraid not. This is something I'll have to deal with, and nothing will make it better.~
@1179 = ~I need to go back there, once this is all over, and see who is still alive. There were too many deaths, for sure.~
@1180 = ~Brandock, all I care about currently is that I am a child of Bhaal. I need to understand this before talking about anything else.~
@1181 = ~Just shut up.~
@1182 = ~Of course. Sorry.~
@1183 = ~I know that we all have to carry our plateful but yours is really stacked up at the moment.~
@1184 = ~I'll come with you, if I'll be at your side still.~
@1185 = ~Let's go and find that evil overlord behind all this.~
@1186 = ~I am sorry to bring this up again, <CHARNAME>, but I am still thinking about the doppelganger invasion in Candlekeep... You know, in a different life, I would have been one of the persons being killed and replaced, down in the catacombs.~ [c#ablank]
@1187 = ~That might have happened, yes.~
@1188 = ~I am very glad it didn't happen that way, Brandock. I like having you at my side.~
@1189 = ~What a thought... But as you said, 'in another life'. What happened, happened.~
@1190 = ~Not necessarily.~
@1191 = ~Hm, you mean the foxes did you a favor?~
@1192 = ~Nope, still don't want to talk about this.~
@1193 = ~It's hypothetical, of course, but seeing all those doppelgangers and knowing of all the infiltrations they've already done, I really don't think I'd have had a chance.~
@1194 = ~I'm very glad, too. Oh, and I also like being at your side, <CHARNAME>, thank you for the kind words.~
@1195 = ~I *was* pondering about that.~
@1196 = ~Maybe it is wishful thinking born out of what happened with that book which still haunts me, and rightfully so. But still, I can't get rid of the thought that it might indeed be a favor the foxes did me. Who knows...~
@1197 = ~This is the absolute first time that I have something like a feeling of thankfulness towards the gods who prevented my going to Candlekeep. If the foxes hadn't stolen my book...~
@1198 = ~And again, the gods showed quite the humor while shaping a man's destiny. I am referring to the foxes. Not the dead in Candlekeep. Definitely not the dead in Candlekeep...~
@1199 = ~Understood. I wanted to phrase my praise to the gods, out of a very egoistic reason, while criticizing their means, but I guess we can skip this, if you are not in the mood.~

/* new for vBeta 7 */
@1200 = ~Nice of you to ask - considering you have your plate full yourself currently with happenings to yourself we can't explain.~
@1201 = ~Even... even if I'd have to stomp as a half-ogre at your side!~
@1202 = ~Oh, but what's happening to me is nothing compared to being expelled from your home and seeing it being invaded by doppelgangers!~
@1203 = ~I'm afraid there is nothing you can do. This is something I'll have to deal with, and nothing will make it better.~
@1204 = ~You mean after you stomped your way through them as a half-oger?~ 
@1205 = ~Oh yes, that's... that's actually funny. Still... I don't think it would have saved me in the end from the doppelgangers.~

/* brandock_shapeshifter_bg1.d */
@1248 = ~Who am I? I am... I mean, theoretically speaking, I *was* the different acquaintance of another polymorphial being of very little intellectual habitus, if phrased in terms of principally conditions...~
@1249 = ~He not speak clear. He dumb, with my brain! Me... bright, with his dumb brain! And clumsy hands... Need help!~
@1250 = ~You are a mage? Stuck in form of a chicken! Because a spell went wrong?! - What a nightmare...~
@1251 = ~<CHARNAME>, I think I know a way to help this poor chicken. I mean man! In my possessions, there is a book with knowledge that might be of help, and I would like to have it, just in case. Please, let us collect my possessions now. The cave is just south east from where we first met, I marked it on your map.~
@1252 = ~So, Melicamp... Master Thalantyr would be your master? *The* master Thalantyr?~ [c#ablank]
@1253 = ~Erm ... haha, would there be *cluck* another one?~
@1254 = ~Of course not. A misread incantation, you said it was? What kind of incantation?~
@1255 = ~Erm ... it was a, er, polymorph one.~
@1256 = ~That fits. I didn't speak up until now, because, frankly, I don't think that my level of expertise will be of much help here... Although, we do have all needed ingredients, and as long as noone would interfere, the spell I have in mind might actually work. But as I said, it's way above my level of expertise and I...~
@1257 = ~Oh, it's a great idea to try, my friend. Anything that spares me, er, I mean Master Thalantyr the hassle *cluck* of having to deal with, er, this, yes?~
@1258 = ~I sense your fear to face your master in this state. <CHARNAME>, I could try and help this poor man. Casting the spell would be not the problem, it's the lack of experience I am worried about. What do you say?~
@1259 = ~That's a good notion. If you think you have a cure, then try.~
@1260 = ~Why would casting a spell "way above your level of expertise" be no problem?~
@1261 = ~I'm not sure this is such a good idea.~
@1262 = ~I'd rather we leave this to Thalantyr, instead of tinkering with magic above your level.~
@1263 = ~No. This might lead to unwanted side effects, so I forbid it.~
@1264 = ~Of course it's not a good idea! It's mine, after all. Question is, whether that's a reason not to try.~
@1265 = ~I know the spell out of a book I studied... very intensely. The book deals with very complex magic and how to perform such magic while lacking the skill that would normally be required. It is a book for learning as well as... enabling magic, so to speak. I'd rather have the book with me, but I do know the spell by heart.~
@1266 = ~Alright, then do it.~
@1267 = ~I know the spell out of my destroyed book which I studied... very intensely. The thing about it is that it was not that valuable because it deals with very complex magic, but because explained how to perform such magic while lacking the skill that would normally be required. It was a book for learning as well as... enabling magic, so to speak.~
@1268 = ~I understand. I guess it's better that way.~
@1269 = ~(exhales) Alright, here we go. Everyone, stand back! Stuck in the form of a chicken! That's unbearable...~
@1270 = ~A half-ogre! Where did ...~
@1271 = ~Bright ... bright light ...~ [c#ablank]
@1272 = ~What ... Help ... I am not ... Not ...~
@1273 = ~Me Brandock! <CHARNAME>, help! Need help ...~
@1274 = ~Er, that didn't work as planned... did it? Brandock? Brandock? *cluck* Oh dear, I guess master Thalantyr will *cluck* will have to help us ...~
@1275 = ~Thalantyr! Yes, yes! Great mage, can help!~
@1276 = ~Come, half-ogre! Brandock needs body back! We go to great mage Thalantyr!~

@1282 = ~Ah, but of course I didn't forget your friend here. (sigh) Well, then let's try our luck once more, shall we?~
@1283 = ~Ah, yes, you look like the friend this unfortunate man tried to describe. I am on it, but I didn't really figure out what the problem was, yet. There is only few magic spells or items able to induce such an outcome, if it is not wild magic we are talking about.~
@1284 = ~I'd need to know the source of this magic. Until then, I need to stabilize your friend here or he'll collapse.~
@1285 = ~... Ah, so this chicken Melicamp is the source of the polymorph spell your unfortunate friend tried to reverse? This is good, and bad. Good, because now I know what to try. Bad, because it is dangerous magic we are dealing with. (sigh) Go and get that skull. It will be far more effective than I realized, helping three creatures at once.~
@1286 = ~And your friend's mind will eventually fade to nothingness. No mind is made to reside in another creature's body without a way to return to its own.~
@1287 = ~Well, what can I say. This worked as planned.~ [c#ablank]
@1288 = ~This is me! This is ... me, yes, all the way down and ... I *think* also on my back. Feet - check, hands - check, my brain works as it is supposed to, and I can *talk* normally. This being something people will regret in time, probably, but ...~
@1289 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>, thank you!~
@1290 = ~And mostly thank you, Master Thalantyr, of course. Without your knowledge and prowess, I would have lost myself in 250 kilograms of green skin. You are the greatest, and best acknowledges wizard I ever met. Grumpy, but also very kind, as you just showed twice.~
@1291 = ~Now, am I not pleased to enable young fools to roam the lands, spreading their foolishness.~
@1292 = ~But I have to ask, although I know I will regret it. Why in the nine hells did you try to polymorph that fool if you can't handle the magic involved?!~
@1293 = ~Erm, I read about it... about something like this. It might have worked, if the half-ogre hadn't been there...~
@1294 = ~Where would you read about something like this? There is only one book that would come to my mind. And that's Bowgentle's Book! Or what is said to be its predecessor, the De Simplex -~
@1295 = ~...Magicae, yes... Erm, that's the book I am referring to. I had time to study it for a while in, er... the great library of Alisarhold...~
@1296 = ~Indeed! So it found a way back into civilization after being lost for so long. And you would have studied it? Interesting. One word of advice, young man. Best you try to keep that knowledge of yours inside your head until you are capable of handling it. Understand? Best you get out now. All of you.~

@1301 = ~I am sorry, <CHARNAME>, for what happened. It was the right spell... for what I had in mind. But not for the exact circumstances and I shouldn't have cast it. I cannot thank you enough for your help. That was... quite an experience. One I'd like to forget, desperately.~
@1302 = ~Really?... But as what? I can't carry heavy things and I'm not a good fighter. I can cook, though - although maybe I should stay away from *anything* that includes a recipe and...~
@1303 = ~Stop babbling, Brandock. I want you as a mage.~
@1304 = ~How about you do what you do best: magic.~
@1305 = ~Brandock, you want to get experience and learn to master magic. Come with me, fight with me, and you might become what you wish.~
@1306 = ~With that attitude, I don't think I'll have a use for you.~
@1307 = ~You mean 'learning by doing'? Hm. According to my first teacher, I wasn't so bad at that, once. Hey, I even have experience with wild magic! Ha. Ha. Ha. Bad joke! But it's a thought, really.~
@1308 = ~I thank you for your trust, <CHARNAME>. Right now, I do not think I am a good mage. I'm not even sure I should call myself a *mage*... But practice could change that, of course... If I stay away from anything beyond my level of expertise.~
@1309 = ~I know I have no other option left than becoming a great, well-versed mage adventurer. Trained in combat through the heat of battle. Maybe even save a village or two? This ... this would indeed put me into a position with great opportunities. And I'd have a lot of practice on the way, oh yes.~
@1310 = ~I am ready, <CHARNAME>, and I know I want to travel with you, and not only because I have no other choice. I am ready for having long, exhausting, tiring days on the road, fighting, instead of... probably long, exhausting, tiring, *and* frustrating days working indoors.~
@1311 = ~Question is: are *you* ready to spend the rest of your quest with me?... But who says you have to decide that now. Let's just see how today goes. And tomorrow. And the day after that...~

@1313 = ~That's how we will do it.~
@1314 = ~Do you always talk this much when making a decision? I need a mage, not a jawsmith!~
@1315 = ~On second thought, forget it. I don't think I'd have a use for you.~
@1316 = ~I guess by now I have proven not to be of any use as an adventurer. We may have joined forces for a while but you are probably already regretting it. I will leave and find my own way from here, if... if you wish.~
@1317 = ~No, Brandock. I want you to come with me.~
@1318 = ~Maybe it is good that book is destroyed, you know. Seeing what can happen if its spells are cast by the less experienced. So, at least some good came of all of that happened.~
@1319 = ~Brandock, you tend to be a bit overambitious, that is all. Mistakes happen to all of us.~
@1320 = ~No way you'll just leave now. I need a mage in this group so you'll stay until I'll find a suitable replacement.~
@1321 = ~Yes, please go. Fare well, Brandock.~
@1322 = ~You... you mean you do not want to send me away?~
@1323 = ~Oh, but you can't make the book responsible if one of its spells is cast at the wrong moment in circumstances that involve wild magic... which is exactly what you said. (sigh) So, you want me to leave?~
@1324 = ~I... I understand.~
@1325 = ~No, not always. Usually, I restrict myself to making senseless, wanna-be funny, but *short* remarks. I only tend to babble if I realize I'll have to re-order my whole life plan for the coming years... Which should not happen again soon, seeing how I destroyed any other possibility already.~
@1326 = ~No? Thank the gods! No, it's a pity, actually. (sigh) Thank you again for your help. Please don't tell me you did it to free the half-ogre...~
@1327 = ~Alright, I'll be in the Jovial Juggler, in case you change your mind. Pondering my ... options.~
@1328 = ~<CHARNAME>, I would be very, very happy to be a member of your group. It's not that I am completely new to adventuring. Coming as far as the Sword Coast on my own was a tale worth telling, I have to say. Or, better not for telling anyone, I suppose.~
@1329 = ~Yes, I would like to continue to travel with you, if you'd allow me.~
@1330 = ~Welcome aboard, then.~
@1331 = ~Only under the condition that you do not usually talk so much.~
@1332 = ~I won't. You'll be surprised how dull travelling with me can be.~
@1333 = ~Great! Then let's go. And <CHARNAME>: unless you start kidnapping grannies or torturing puppies, I'll be on your side with no further interruptions. You have my word on that.~
@1334 = ~[Brandock]The half-ogre incident still occupies me, <CHARNAME>. But not only because I am mortified that something like that could happen. It's also... the way I felt while being a half-ogre.~
@1335 = ~Yes?~
@1336 = ~Make it quick, Brandock.~
@1337 = ~Do you have an idea how my brain works? Normal people are like this: they get an input, they think about how they want to react, they do it.~
@1338 = ~Mine goes like this: I get an input, I think about how to react - I get scared it might not be the right thing to do - I think about other possibilities, weigh the different options - and whatever it was I was supposed to react to either smacked me in the face or went for a coffee in the meantime.~
@1339 = ~While being in the half-ogre body, life was easy. Sure, I still *tried* to think about and weigh different options - but it just didn't work, my brain capacity wasn't nearly sufficient. I usually reacted to external stimuli the moment they appeared. There was much less noise in my head.~
@1340 = ~In short - I was a hammer, and every problem was a nail. Life was *easy*.~
@1341 = ~I think I understand what you mean.~
@1342 = ~You could try and change accordingly.~
@1343 = ~It might have been easy, but was it really better?~
@1344 = ~I'm not saying I want to be less intelligent. Not at all.~
@1345 = ~That's easier said than done. If I could switch off some of my thoughts and fears I would.~
@1346 = ~No, it definitely wasn't.~
@1347 = ~Life as half-ogre was also dull, very dull. I am very glad it is over - but I will always long for the clearity that comes with just living in the moment.~
@1348 = ~[Elvenhair doppelganger]Ah, my young adventurers! I am so glad I've found you! Tethtoril told me about what happened. This is so unfortunate! I came through the hidden exit as soon as I heard. Come with me, I'll show you the way.~
@1349 = ~[Brandock]Master Elvenhair! It is you... is it?... There is doppelgangers everywhere, Master Elvenhair!~
@1350 = ~[Elvenhair doppelganger]Yes, my young friend.~
@1351 = ~[Elvenhair doppelganger]Come, come, I'll show you the ways of the sagesss...~
@1352 = ~I... I am... I am... <CHARNAME>, what am I?!~
@1353 = ~You turned into a half-ogre, I think.~
@1354 = ~A half-ogre who just slashed a doppelganger on his own, as it seems.~
@1355 = ~What on earth is going on?~
@1356 = ~Keep away, foul creature!~
@1357 = ~That sound... Was that your shirt?...~
@1358 = ~It's me, it's me, <CHARNAME> - Brandock! At least I think so...~
@1359 = ~I turned into a half-ogre! And my hands... my hands are full of... I just killed a doppelganger - with my HANDS! Look at this... this... by the gods, is this *my* arm muscles?~
@1360 = ~Brandock? Why are you a half-ogre?~
@1361 = ~How did you do that?~
@1362 = ~Nice. Do you have more of that up your sleeve?~
@1363 = ~I don't know... I... I cast a spell - I think?~
@1364 = ~No, not really...~
@1365 = ~Oh - oh boy.~
@1366 = ~I... I am me again. I came back... I did come back... Oh, I feel all sober now. We are still inside the catacombs... We need to get out of here.~
@1367 = ~You are white as a ghost, Brandock. Are you alright?~
@1368 = ~Wait a minute there. You shapeshifted into a half-ogre. Care to explain?~
@1369 = ~I see you put your magic to good use. Can we get going?~
@1370 = ~Well, at least I'm no longer green - ah, what a weak attempt of humor.~
@1371 = ~I am shaking all over, <CHARNAME>... I'm not sure what happened here. All I know is that I need to talk to Master Thalantyr, and quick. This is connected to the body switch with that half-ogre, I am sure of it.~
@1372 = ~I... I surely hope this doppelganger doesn't mean Master Elvenhair got hurt...~
@1373 = ~[male Ranger]Hey, I recognize you. Seems like you found some friends now. Still, I need you to clean up your stuff after camping out in the wild!~
@1374 = ~[Brandock]Oh, I guess you are mistaking me for the man who is camping out to the west of here. We do look astonishingly alike but that's not me, I'm afraid.~
@1375 = ~[Brandock]Er... I am pretty sure you are mistaking me for someone?~
@1376 = ~[Brandock]Unless you *are* referring to me and the time I travelled alone - but that's been some time since then and I wouldn't know that I left any trash... apart from things the foxes took from me, ahem.~
@1377 = ~[male ranger]Hmm, maybe I did mistake you for someone else who was camping not far from here to the west. No hard feelings, then, and farewell.~
@1378 = ~My friend has a question with regard to the half-ogre incident that happened a while back. Brandock?~
@1379 = ~Master Thalantyr, I had a most unfortunate experience: I turned into a half-ogre recently! It left me quite startled, as you can imagine, so I wanted to ask you what is happening to me!~
@1380 = ~Hmm, you were that mage switching bodies with a half-ogre sooner, weren't you? It was wild magic that lead to your first change, and it seems its effect are not completely gone. Your brain remembers the change - or the memories of the half-ogre that occupied your body, and your magic made your body atone to this remembrence because you were in some highly emotional state.~
@1381 = ~Please, Master Thalantyr - what does it mean? Can it be cured? Will it turn me into a half-ogre completely? Please tell me you know the answers to these questions!~
@1382 = ~I can tell you with certainty: it is not an ongoing process of permanent transformation. But you will not get rid of it either. You have been given the ability to take on both forms and make use of their advantages. Learn to master it. Some others have used a lot of magic to achieve this.~
@1383 = ~The reason I know this is not a glorious one for me. Just as you are afflicted with the half-ogre form - the half-ogre is with a human shape. He found his way back to me after accidentally shifting into a man.~
@1384 = ~W... you've got to be kidding.~
@1385 = ~I'm afraid this is the truth. Thinking I needed to help the half-ogre stave off a slow permanent transformation, I applied more magic. Instead, I fixed a temporary transformation ability and now locked him into the form of a human. He might be able to transform into a half-ogre again when the effects of my magic wears off, but when this will be not even I can predict.~
@1386 = ~I don't know where the "half-oger" is now. Don't look at me like that - he didn't want to be helped, otherwise I would have done so after the fiasco. I had even clarified with the Morning Temple at Beregost that he would get protection there.~
@1387 = ~So somewhere out there, a half-og... Oh by the gods. <CHARNAME>! <CHARNAME>, that's the man who set up camp west from here!~
@1388 = ~You know -  the one mentioned by the ranger we met near here!~
@1389 = ~A man who looks just like me and camps in the wilderness. That must be him!...~
@1390 = ~Let's get out of here, my head is spinning. Thank you, Master Thalantyr. I will try to make the best of it....~
@1391 = ~Melicamp, do you... Do you sometimes still turn into a chicken?~
@1392 = ~I *cluck* I do not turn into one! This is still no laughing matter, why do you ask?~
@1393 = ~No, I'm not making fun of you - half-ogre guy here, as you surely remember... (mumbles) But you seem to have some remains of your time as a bird, nontheless... (Brandock clears his throat.) Did you ever... erm, have the impression your body still thinks it's a chicken... somehow?~
@1394 = ~Ah, right, it's you. That's absolutely hilarious, by the way - the half-ogre looks exactly like you now!~
@1395 = ~Wait - w...?~
@1396 = ~Ah, right, it's you. Should have guessed, haha!~
@1397 = ~Well, I *do* dream about jucy worms from time to time... And sometimes in bed, I want to put my head under my armpit. But Thalantyr assured me that the magic on me was a different one and I won't have to fear to turn into a *cluck* a werechicken...~
@1398 = ~I see... Thank you for your time.~
@1399 = ~Please, let us go to Thalantyr. If anyone knows what magic might be involved in my half-ogre change, it will be him.~
@1400 = ~I was a half-ogre... I turned into a half-ogre... no, I still can't wrap my head around it.~
@1401 = ~Thalantyr made it very clear that the half-ogre shape will stay with me. So I am forever connected to this form. I... have no choice, I have to learn to handle it.~
@1402 = ~And you will, Brandock.~
@1403 = ~Is there anything I can do to support you?~
@1404 = ~Tell me when you're done. I don't have time for this.~
@1405 = ~Yes, but not while in my group. I hired a mage.~
@1406 = ~[Brandock]Thank you, <CHARNAME>. But doing magic is my strength. And I can't do that while being in the half-ogre shape. I'm scared I will be in this form when we'd need my magic... and that I might get stuck in that form forever... Because it is *not* a polymorphing spell that will wear off!~
@1407 = ~I am afraid, <CHARNAME>. Afraid that I won't be able to change back. What if I get stuck?~
@1408 = ~(Brandock pauses.) No, I have to finally admit to myself what my problem is. I... I'm afraid that I won't *want* to change back if I'm a half-ogre.~
@1409 = ~What do you mean?~
@1410 = ~Why wouldn't you?~
@1411 = ~Hmm, you meantioned how the world seems to be easier for you while being half-ogre. Does it have to do with that?~
@1412 = ~Yes! Exactly.~
@1413 = ~The world looks so much simpler while being half-ogre. Me hammer, everything else nails! No mulling around, no thinking back and forth.... no self-doubt! I am just... yes, I just *am*. End of sentence. No thoughts running in the background of my brain, making some problems more complicated than they are....~
@1414 = ~Doesn't that sound wonderful?~
@1415 = ~And no curiosity, no learning of new knowledge, no finding of new wisdom!~
@1416 = ~It does! That's what is terrifying me!~
@1417 = ~Yes, but I don't need all this as a hlaf-ogre - that's what is terrifying me!~
@1418 = ~That I do not *want* to come back, you know?~
@1419 = ~Yes, a little. But do you really think so? You have such a curious mind. That doesn't stop just because you are in half-ogre shape with a smaller brain! And as soon as you'd notice that you can't learn as well while being a half-ogre I am sure you'd transform back.~
@1420 = ~And why would that be bad, as long as you are happy with it?~
@1421 = ~You already went through it before. In the catacombs you changed back once the danger was over.~
@1422 = ~You are right, that's an unreliability. Maybe we should part ways.~
@1423 = ~Yes, yes I know, but...~
@1424 = ~There is another problem. I'm an unreliability for our safety!~
@1425 = ~With everything going on, I turn into an unreliability. You can't imagine how much this mortifies me.~
@1426 = ~With Sarevok still being a threat - I turn into an unreliability. You can't imagine how mich this mortifies me.~
@1427 = ~You go into battle with a mage and find yourself in it with a tank only? This won't do! I might not threaten you in person, but this does!~
@1428 = ~Only if you aren't master of your shapeshifting.~
@1429 = ~Duh, Brandock - that's why you need to master this shapeshifting, not trying to suppress it!~
@1430 = ~You... you are righ. I need to master it. I will... I will no longer suppress it but shapeshift when you want me to. May the gods help me...~
@1431 = ~You... you want me to go?~
@1432 = ~Yes. You are too great an unreliability as a mage. Farewell.~
@1433 = ~No, not necessarily. But I need you to be in control of your magic if you are going to stay.~
@1434 = ~Then I will go. Farewell to you too, <CHARNAME>. I doubt we will meet again.~
@1435 = ~There is one more thing... I can't shake the thought of the half-ogre... human-half-ogre... Half-human-half-oger. I'm speechless that he would be affected too - but that makes sense, yes. <CHARNAME> - I feel guilty about it, because it was my attempted spell that started the whole thing.~
@1436 = ~We have to go look for him - please!~
@1437 = ~We have to go to him again. He may still feel comfortable in his camp, but that will change eventually.~
@1438 = ~At some point, he *will* want to connect with people, and I'd rather he'll have a good start when that happens.~
@1439 = ~Thalantyr mentioned the Morning Temple at Beregost where he could go to until he gets settled in. I have an idea how I could peak his interest....~
@1440 = ~[Halboger]You visiting?~
@1441 = ~Er... hello there.~
@1442 = ~(mutters) Gods, you look a lot like me... (clears his throat) Are you alright, so alone here in the wild?~
@1443 = ~You look almost exactly like Brandock. Who are you?~
@1444 = ~Brandock, are you sure you two aren't related?~
@1445 = ~What are you doing here on your own?~
@1446 = ~Sorry for the intrusion. We will be going.~
@1447 = ~[Brandock]I'm most definitely certain, yes.~
@1448 = ~[Halboger]With me everything fine. You may go.~
@1449 = ~Alright... Malm. Have a nice day.~
@1450 = ~[Halboger]Me Malm. I am new.~
@1451 = ~[Halboger]Sitting here and thinking.~
@1452 = ~[Brandock]You are the half-ogre... Do you remember me? How are you?~
@1453 = ~Malm as human being has a very different approach to colors, thoughts, language... all very fascinating. Sits here and ponders about being and the meaning of life. Uses words like "ponders"...~
@1454 = ~[Brandock]Malm... I feel responsible for what happened to you. You seem to enjoy your human shape. We could help you to settle in with people. Being alone in the wild is not good for a human.~
@1455 = ~Malm doesn't want to leave. Malm here at home. Likes it here. Thoughts are spinning...~
@1456 = ~[Brandock]By the gods, this is like watching a child learn to walk.... Malm, now you still like being alone. But at some point that won't be enough any more, and then you'll need other people around you with whom you can exchange ideas.~
@1457 = ~I need something to peak his curiosity to go amongst people. Wait a moment, <CHARNAME>.~
@1458 = ~What are you tinkering?~
@1459 = ~Yes, go ahead and fiddle with sticks and stones, we have nothing else to do.~
@1460 = ~Here, already finished.~
@1461 = ~What is it?~
@1462 = ~Is this some kind of puzzle toy?~
@1463 = ~And you think this will gain a half-ogres interest?~
@1464 = ~My father is a carpenter, <CHARNAME>. I worked more on wood with my hands than was good for the workshop... I was never good at it, but some things I remember.~
@1465 = ~You think this will lure him out of the wilderness?~
@1466 = ~Exactly.~
@1467 = ~It's a toy for skill and patience both.~
@1468 = ~Try to pull the stone through the loops - but without tangling them.~
@1469 = ~Oh - tricky.~
@1470 = ~I wasn't aware you can make something like this.~
@1471 = ~Isn't it? It took me half a day the first time I got hands on such a riddle toy. I was so thrilled!~
@1472 = ~It's worth a try. If Malm thinks anything like I do, he'll be fascinated by it. Malm - look here, I have a puzzle for you.~
@1473 = ~[Halboger]That very interesting. Makes head hurt a little. Malm likes it - with this head. And with these hands. Are more skilled than half-ogre ones.~
@1474 = ~I knew it! Malm, there is much more to discover - in the cities of people. To the east of here is a great temple. There they will take you in and help you accustom to life as a human, if you want.~
@1475 = ~[Halboger]Oh. Then Malm wants to go there after all. Will break camp. And clear away litter like other man said.~
@1476 = ~Hello! Malm is very happy here. I listen to the singing every day. Singing is beautiful!~
@1477 = ~I just slashed with my hands... slashed and slashed... while feeling how the dopplegangers skin tore, and...~
@1478 = ~I meant the half-ogre transformation.~
@1479 = ~Yes, Brandock, I saw *that* part. I meant what happened before. Why are you a half-ogre?~

/* brandock_shapeshifter_bg1_sod.d */
@1480 = ~Ah, found friends already? That's good - I guess. Just make sure you stay out of trouble, yes?~
@1481 = ~Wait, I mistook you for that other guy for a moment there. The resemblance is striking! Apologies for the confusion.~
@1482 = ~So, I hope sobering up in here helped you to remember to behave yourself in public... wait, you are not the half-ogre turning man we arrested yesterday.~
@1483 = ~Yes, I also mistook him for that other guy for a moment there. The resemblance is striking! Apologies for the confusion.~
@1484 = ~No offence taken, really. But I am looking for that man you were referring to. He's, er, my cousin. So he was released already? Where did he go?~
@1485 = ~Not yet, but he's to be released any minute. He's in the second last cell on the left.~
@1486 = ~Hmph. If you insist, he's just down the aisle. Be sure to make it quick! I want all of you out in ten.~

/* new for v1 */

@1490 = ~Alright, pal, seems they let you go again. That's great and all, but I don't want you anywhere near my liqueur... wait, you aren't the one that caused trouble here recently. Sorry for mistaking you for someone else, although you do look very alike.~
@1491 = ~Yes, I know who you are referring to. That was my, uhm, cousin.~
@1492 = ~He won't give you any more trouble, bartender.~

/* brandock_shapeshifter.d */
@1496 = ~Uh-oh, here I am... My goodness, my arms *are* thick... and green... and everything looks so much smaller from up here. And my magic... is gone! (murmurs) Everything is alright... everything is alright...~
@1497 = ~I don't think I need to be afraid that I wouldn't change back. I am much too nervous for that right now. Nevertheless - please let me know immediately if you don't need me as a half-ogre anymore!~
@1498 = ~(Brandock exhales audibly.) My magic is back again. The shifting felt almost natural - in both ways, I might add.~
@1499 = ~Ah - that really takes a load off my mind, <CHARNAME>. Thank you for being here with me! So - if you want, then I'll change into a half-ogre again any time. After all, I want to feel just as comfortable in this form... And I think I am not so much afraid of it any more.~

/* brandock_lorepath_bg1.d */
@1500 = ~What kind of madness was that? I will have a look at this mage's spellbook.~ [c#ablank]
@1501 = ~Could I have a look at that book? Oh... oh, yes. This is... nothing I will make use of myself, thank you very much.~ [c#ablank]
@1502 = ~Could I have a look at Dradeel's spell book? Hmm... No, I do not think I have an idea how to read this. It would make an interesting object for study, though. Er, I did not intend to suggest that this would be a valid reason to keep it from the poor man. It's not *that* interesting.~ [c#ablank]
@1503 = ~To be attacked out of the blue... I should be used to it by now, shouldn't I? Let me have a look into those mages' spellbooks. They were quite powerful...~ [c#ablank]

@1505 = ~It's not like we wouldn't have any time at all. Have a stroll around, if you like. I'll wait.~
@1506 = ~We are here on a mission. Let's keep going.~
@1507 = ~Look at all this knowledge! Oh, oh, I can't wait to get my hands on the books! <CHARNAME>, let's get on with what we have to do, before I forget my promise to remain at your side until the investigation is done.~ [c#ablank]
@1508 = ~You'll have enough time when we are done, Brandock. For now, let's focus on why we are here.~
@1509 = ~Of course.~
@1510 = ~Oh-oh, really? Just a quick look what kind of books there actually *are* - so I'll know what to look forward to!~
@1511 = ~Oh-oh, really? Just a quick look what kind of books there actually *are* - so I'll know what I'll be missing...~
@1512 = ~Young man, if you lean any closer to the table you might drool onto my newly acquired books, which I would find most unfortunate.~
@1513 = ~I'm... I'm so sorry, Master Elvenhair. I didn't mean to!...~
@1514 = ~I see you have a curious mind, and a good heart, my friend. Feel free to stay and look through the books and tomes you see here. They are for others to appreciate the contained wisdom - but you'll have to do so now, because I will send them on their way to Candlekeep soon.~
@1515 = ~You are very generous, Master Elvenhair.~
@1516 = ~I... I probably shouldn't. Not after... But...~
@1517 = ~I... would like to do so right away! Could we spare the moment, <CHARNAME>... Please?~
@1518 = ~Fine, I'll wait.~
@1519 = ~No, we don't have the time.~
@1520 = ~Thank you! This won't take a minute... More like several hours... Gnah, I will be quick.~
@1521 = ~Ooh, this is most unfortunate... But I'll restrain myself then.~
@1522 = ~To lose one's mind so - in what one believes to be love, while hurting the object of desire... Well, Master Ragefast surely had a clear mind when collecting his library. And look at the size of that telescope!~ [c#ablank]
@1523 = ~Master Ragefast, may I have a look at your precious collection of magic books? I see a lot of names I only have seen in well-known libraries before...~
@1524 = ~Hm? Yes, yes, do that, my interested young friend. I have no mood for studying books in my current state...~
@1525 = ~<CHARNAME>, could we spare a minute? I see a lot of names I only have seen in well-known libraries before...~
@1526 = ~Alright, Brandock. I'll wait for a moment.~
@1527 = ~We've been in here long enough. Let's go.~
@1528 = ~Thank you!~
@1529 = ~Books! So many books! Many, many wizard books!...~ [c#ablank]
@1530 = ~Yes, have a look around, Brandock.~
@1531 = ~Brandock, I want to get out of here as fast as possible. Let's go.~
@1532 = ~Oh, books! Dwarven books! *Old* dwarven books! <CHARNAME>, I *have* to have a look at these. Please!~ [c#ablank]
@1533 = ~It's alright, I think. We can have a small rest here while we wait.~
@1534 = ~Brandock, I need you to be on alert. This is dangerous ground.~
@1535 = ~Thank you! I'll try to be quick.~
@1536 = ~(sigh) Despite the fact how we achieved this, this is definitely a very interesting book. I don't think I'll be able to build a skyship, but reading about it is most enlightning. Still... I'd prefer I wouldn't have had the chance to go through these spellbooks...~

/* new for vbeta 4 */
@1537 = ~Hm, that's an interesting read - mind controlling slimes... But no, I don't think we should try to use this. Not without a *lot* of more testing - which I lack the time to do... and also interest, to be honest.~
@1538 = ~Brrrr. "Sculptures" out of petrified people. Well, I guess that gnome should have stayed "on the roads" himself, then we wouldn't have had to kill him. Ah, looking at spellbooks from people like him makes me a little sick sometimes, I have to admit.~
@1539 = ~Why do people always have to attack us? Great, this one's spell book is no longer useful, it's singed. I'll see whether the other ones are still readable.~

@1542 = ~I'd love to say that it was his own fault to being killed for being so aggressive - and arrogant about his own power - but it *was* us barging into his house uninvited - and actually killing him. I'm not sure I like our role in this... I will have a look into his spellbook, though.~
@1543 = ~Why did we have to barge in like that and kill those young women... <CHARNAME>, if we do not have the means to snatch things from under people's noses without them feeling like defending them with their lives then *maybe* we shouldn't accept such tasks.~
@1544 = ~This is definitely a very interesting book. I don't think I'll be able to build a skyship, but reading about it is most enlightning.~

/* new for v1 */
@1545 = ~Ooh, I also see the book Master Thalantyr was looking for - "Thee Oldde Magyck: Volume II". Maybe we could have it?~

/* brandock_lorepath_sod.d */
@1650 = ~Ooh, look at all the books laying on the floor, what a shame... There is good books here, <CHARNAME>.~
@1651 = ~Go ahead and have a look around. That is what we are here for, after all.~
@1652 = ~There's enemies nearby, Brandock. We need to move.~
@1653 = ~Hmm, this is frustrating. How can the title be readable, but the content is not? I've never seen this language before. There is even a note: "wise to think backwards." But without the needed lexicon, even that note is not helpful for deciphering the book.~
@1654 = ~This is one of the moments where curiosity takes me over. I'm tempted to grab some of the old tomes laying around in the hopes they are worth enough, head to the great librabry Candlekeep, and study this book just to know what it says or whether it's a hoax. Er... I'm not saying I'd *do* that...~
@1655 = ~You want us to keep that tome?~
@1656 = ~I understand the feeling. Maybe you'll have time for that later.~
@1657 = ~Do you see books here that are valuable enough to grant entrance to Candlekeep?~
@1658 = ~Are you regretting to be on the road with me?~
@1659 = ~Focus, Brandock. If you can't learn from this book, then leave it.~
@1660 = ~We can't talk now. We need to move on.~
@1661 = ~I wouldn't mind just keeping it in my bookcase, but I'm not sure when I'd be able to study it. Looking at the others we found here I guess it deals with liches, heh.~
@1662 = ~I'd be surprised if there would *not* be such valuable books here. They all look rather old, not to say ancient. Would you like the books to grant you entrance to Candlekeep?~
@1663 = ~It would be nice to have one, just in case.~
@1664 = ~No, I'd rather sell it.~
@1665 = ~Not necessarily. I was just curious.~
@1666 = ~No! Not at all.~
@1667 = ~Keeping this "Tome of Ancient Knowledge" is not of high priority for me, I doubt I'll really study it anytime soon. This is more a case of "my curiosity is peaked - and my pride is hurt to admit that I have no idea what this book is about".~
@1668 = ~Especially since I'd need help to even understand which language this is. Hmm, The priests of Oghma in Athkatla should know this... But I won't insist on us taking it there, heh.~
@1669 = ~Of course.~
@1670 = ~That's what I'm saying! I can't learn from it *right now* by just looking at it. But there *might* be valuable knowledge inside.~
@1671 = ~Or maybe not, and you'll have spent lots of time to find out.~
@1672 = ~Or maybe that, yes. Although I'd *be* interested what language this is.~
@1673 = ~I understand. Unfortunately, I'd need time and ressources to study the books to guess their worth - so unless we were planning on stuffing our backpacks with lots of them to make sure, I fear we will leave without such a valuable book.~
@1674 = ~Hephernaan's Ritual Notes? This is... wow. Wow. Put that away, <CHARNAME>. I... I saw enough.~

/* brandock_lorepath_bg2 */
@1800 = ~No, nothing to learn for me from that assassin's mage spellbook - even though she was quite powerful. These days are really over now.~
@1801 = ~You know what got to me? I couldn't even look at Irenicus' spellbook! Because of battling him in hell, I wasn't able to look at his spellbook. That surely would have been an interesting read!~
@1802 = ~I understand. You feel like being deprived from your righteous battle reward.~
@1803 = ~Yes, indeed. I'd be interested to see it as well, I admit.~
@1804 = ~Do you expect me to feel sorry for you?~
@1805 = ~Exactly!~
@1806 = ~Maybe a little bit?...~
@1807 = ~I am so sure I could have learned from it. I was *so* looking foreward to just holding his spellbook in my hands. Don't get me wrong - I am happy with you having your sould back and Irenicus no longer being a threat and all... But...~
@1808 = ~Ah, dang. I really miss the old times. I'm not talking about being chased by what felt like an over-powerful foe. I mean the exciting tingle after a battle when picking up an enemies' spellbook and just diving into the new knowledge...~
@1809 = ~Surely you feel a lot wiser and well-versed now, with all the knowledge you alrady accumulated in that brain of yours?~
@1810 = ~(teasingly) Yes, look at how powerful we became. It's such a shame!~
@1811 = ~I can't believe you're finding a reason to complain about literally everything.~
@1812 = ~(sigh) On the contrary, <CHARNAME>. The more I learn the more I have the feeling of not knowing much at all. And it's getting worse, because on the level I reached, ackquiring new knowledge is getting harder.~
@1813 = ~Yeah - I know I am lamenting on a very high level. I don't want to switch back to those times - not at all. I'm quite content with what I achieved... And yet, I'll allow myself to dwell on a little feeling of nostalgia for a while.~
@1814 = ~I'm getting too powerful, <CHARNAME>... (smirks) I'm not complaining. It's just - I can't learn as much from the spellbooks of mages we defeat any more. I feel like a drug addict not getting the needed dose! Give me MOOARRR... Er - I absolutely did not mean that I want us having to go against more powerful mages, not at all.~
@1815 = ~It's a blessing and a pity at the same time.~
@1816 = ~(teasingly) Oh noes! You mean you actually *achieved* something you settled out to do?~
@1817 = ~You mean you won't delay us at every corner any more?~
@1818 = ~Haha! I know it's shocking but it appears I did.~
@1819 = ~No... probably not any more.~
@1820 = ~That's well put.~
@1821 = ~Still, it's a fact. The times where I learned from every spellbook I encountered are over.~
@1822 = ~[Brandock]Oh - I see some new books I haven't seen before. Just a moment, <CHARNAME>. I need to have a look...~
@1823 = ~Sure, I guess that's what they are for.~
@1824 = ~Brandock, those books won't go anywhere. We are here for something else.~
@1825 = ~I see you already cleaned the blood from the book shelves! Thank you so much! You have no idea what this means to me.~
@1826 = ~You are welcome, good, er... sir and friend of m'<PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@1827 = ~[Brandock]Now I can have a look at these books, yes?~ [c#ablank]
@1828 = ~Ooh, some of the book shelves got blood stains. That's a shame...~
@1829 = ~Sure, go ahead.~
@1830 = ~Let's get moving, Brandock.~
@1831 = ~[Brandock]Oh - books...~
@1832 = ~Yes, take a look around, but be careful with traps.~
@1833 = ~Yeah, sure, go ahead and take your time studying them. It's not like we are hunted and Imoen and I just lost our souls.~
@1834 = ~Yeah, sure, go ahead and take your time studying them. It's not like we are hunted and I just lost my soul.~
@1835 = ~Brandock, we really don't have time for that now.~
@1836 = ~Thank you. I'll try to be *really* quick. It's not just any books. Some look antique. Maybe they'll tell us something about our "huntress".~
@1837 = ~It's rare to have the spellbook of a living mage in my hands... Interesting choice of spells. We should bring this back to Lazarus as soon as possible. Being without ones spellbook is not funny - especially in a situation like this.~

/* brandock_bookrestore_bg2.d */
@1900 = ~So, Brandock - here we are. Show your book to the monks to receive "Oghma's Wisdom".~
@1901 = ~Here is a King's Tear and 5000 gold as requested. Please have a look at Brandock's book now.~
@1902 = ~Let me see... Oh, this is very interesting magic indeed. A preservation spell, you say? Yes, we could seek more wisdom about this magic. Bring us a King's Tear and 5000 gold, and we will investigate the book with all the knowledge Oghma granted us.~
@1903 = ~Very well. Let me see the book...~
@1904 = ~Very interesting. Very interesting indeed.~
@1905 = ~[Brandock]So, this is how the preservation magic in the book worked. I... I undestood it. I actually understood it. This was most enlightening.~
@1906 = ~Just a moment... Here, please send this letter with all gathered knowledge about the book's magic to Master Elvenhair in Candlekeep - as well as Master Purgan in Alisarhold.~
@1907 = ~[Brandock]Just a moment... Here, please send this letter with all gathered knowledge about the book's magic to Master Purgan in Alisarhold.~
@1908 = ~[Brandock]This is the moment of truth I anticipated for so long. I sought and found "Oghma's Wisdom" about how to write spells into the transformed De Simplex Magicae.~
@1909 = ~[Brandock]I... I will come back with regard to this for more of your knowledge - probably. But the book will stay with me, for now. I swear I will keep it safe - and keep it out of the reach of the Coweld Wizards as well as other megalomaniac mages.~
@1910 = ~We will do as you ask. This gathered knowledge is interesting for us as well. Fare well.~
@1911 = ~[Brandock]We have all we need with us! <CHARNAME>... Please?~
@1912 = ~Yes, go ahead.~
@1913 = ~No, not today, Brandock.~
@1914 = ~[Brandock]Very... very well.~
@1915 = ~[Brandock]We have a King's Tear - and the needed 5000 gold the Temple of Oghma requested. (Brandock inhales audibly.) Please, let us return to the temple of Oghma as soon as possible, so this whole book... "affair" comes to an end.~
@1916 = ~[Brandock]<CHARNAME>, this is it. This is the moment I was waiting for, hoping for, *working* for for so long. The De Simplex Magicae is restored - my guilt is quenched.~
@1917 = ~[PC Reply](teasingly) Oh no! That is horrible! What are you going to do with your time now?~
@1918 = ~[PC Reply]I'm so happy for you, Brandock.~
@1919 = ~[PC Reply]It was your dedication that brought you here.~
@1920 = ~[PC Reply]Ah, so that's what kept you occupied since we visited the monks.~
@1921 = ~[PC Reply]Yes, it's over. I surely hope I don't have to hear that name ever again.~
@1922 = ~[Brandock]Ha, yes, that is so true... It was my dedication to the book that made me study it until I fell asleep on the road where the foxes could get to it.~
@1923 = ~[PC Reply]You know what I meant.~
@1924 = ~[PC Reply]So, what are you goin to *do* now?~
@1925 = ~[Brandock]I did indeed.~
@1926 = ~[Brandock]I thank you.~
@1927 = ~[Brandock]<CHARNAME>, ever since we left the temple I am trying to wrap my head around a *decision* I already made and that's scaring me to hells. I... I decided to refill the De Simplex Magicae with spells myself.~
@1928 = ~[PC Reply]That's a great idea! I am sure you can do it.~
@1929 = ~[PC Reply]Why the shy look? Don't you think you can do it?~
@1930 = ~[PC Reply]I figured as much, after seeing you holding on to it like that.~
@1931 = ~[PC Reply]If you think that's a good idea...~
@1932 = ~[PC Reply]I didn't expect you to. What made you change your mind?~
@1933 = ~[Brandock]I never said it's a *good* idea.~
@1934 = ~[Brandock]Yes, I *do* think I can do it. That's what scares me.~
@1935 = ~[Brandock]Then you have a better judgement of my talent than me until I talked to the monks in the Tmple of Oghma.~
@1936 = ~[Brandock]Hahaha! I'd have an idea or two, to be honest. Helping out a very good friend without being distracted by a self-sustained guilt trap would be one, for example.~
@1937 = ~[PC Reply](teasingly) That sounds like a great idea, Brandock. Let's do that! Do I know them?~
@1938 = ~[Brandock]Hahaha! Gods, <CHARNAME>, how I enjoy your jesting. It feels so good to laugh like this - after all the time that passed.~
@1939 = ~[Brandock]Now we will continue with what the gods are forcing us to do, I guess... but without this constant nagging in the back of my head that, deep down, I'm nothing but a failure.~
@1940 = ~[Brandock]I feel like I should hold onto something, or I'll float away - that's how relieved I am.~
@1941 = ~[PC Reply](teasingly) I could stand on your foot for a little, if it helps.~
@1942 = ~[PC Reply]I can imagine.~
@1943 = ~[PC Reply]Are we done here?~
@1944 = ~[Brandock]Hahaha! That would definitely distract me, yes.~
@1945 = ~[Bandock]I walked into the temple, convinced that I would not take the book out again. Seeking the wisdom of the monks - Oghma's wisdom - was easy enough. But to refill the pages with spells? Spells that are as easy and cheap to cast as were the ones originally inside? I was *convinced* that I wasn't experienced enough, that I surely would finally destroy it - that I shouldn't even try.~
@1946 = ~[Brandock]And then I talked to the monks, and... and I started to understand. I started to *understand* the magic in that book, <CHARNAME>.~
@1947 = ~[Brandock]So - I think I can do this. I *know* I could do this, given a little more experience and some pre-studies before I tackle the real thing. But... but I didn't wrap my mind around the thought that I *will* be doing this. It's... it's the De Simplex Magicae! I'm stuck in a loop where my heart says yes - and my mind yells OH GODS NO.~
@1948 = ~You should listen to your heart.~
@1949 = ~[Brandock]Ouch...~
@1950 = ~If you feel this insecure then it means something. I wouldn't do this if you feel this way.~
@1951 = ~[Brandock]The De Simplex Magicae... I was its owner for so long - I learned everything I could from it. I studied the spell recipes, I learned about the restoration magic. There is nothing else I could learn from it.~
@1952 = ~[Brandock]Oh wow, this sounded really arrogant. But... truth is, there is nothing more that I could learn from it without the help of someone even *more* experienced than me.~
@1953 = ~The magic in the book was hidden for so long. It really is no problem to wait a little longer.~
@1954 = ~Just tell me when you'll have something useful coming out of this. I don't want to talk about it any more until then.~
@1955 = ~[Brandock]This I want, and I *will* write the spells back into the De Simplex Magicae. Eventually... I paid *very* close attention to how the book's preservation magic worked. I want to work with my new knowledge next time I'll sit down for scroll scribing.~
@1956 = ~[Brandock]This I want, and I *will* write the spells back into the De Simplex Magicae. Eventually... I paid *very* close attention to how the book's preservation magic worked. I'm not experienced enough to work myself with it yet, but I'll let you know as soon as I will be.~
@1957 = ~[Brandock]That's what I think, too - right before I get the next nervous breakdown.~
@1958 = ~[Brandock]I definitely will not do anything with the book unless I am really sure about what I'm doing.~
@1959 = ~[Brandock]My thoughts, exactly. Now I only have to believe them myself.~
@1960 = ~[Brandock]The book and its magic was hidden so long indeed. The gods put it into my hand... and for some reason, let me, er, "unlock" the hidden magic in it. I *know* I can make it whole again. I just... I just need some more time, and a lot more experience. And - a little more self-confidence would be great, too.~
@1961 = ~[Brandock]Gods, I really was hoping to be rid of it after the visit to the temple... But nooo, I have to walk this path to the end, there is no easy way out... Oh, who am I kidding! I *want* to do this, <CHARNAME>! I *want* to understand its magic, every little last bit of it! I will never give it out of my hands, unless there is nothing more I could learn from it!~
@1962 = ~It's a very useful book, though. And it's *complete*! Did I mention that the De Simplex Magicae is *complete* again?~
@1964 = ~That's... that's it. Here it is - the completed, new version of the De Simplex Magicae.~
@1965 = ~Well, the books name translates to "of the simple magic". It was even simple for me! I'm *not* referring to how I discovered the preservation magic inside it. I meant for writing the spells back in to make it a powerful magic ressouce again. This book offered a "simple" way all the way through - from writing spells on the pages to casting them.~
@1966 = ~I'm pretty sure your experience and talent helped quite a bit.~
@1967 = ~Don't make it sound as if it was really easy. You came a long way until now.~
@1968 = ~If it was that easy, I wonder why it took so long.~
@1969 = ~My friend Brandock wanted to show you a tome of "Ancient Wisdom" he can't read himself.~
@1970 = ~Thank you for taking the time, <CHARNAME>. Here it is.~
@1971 = ~Oh, how very interesting. This is a very ancient language, not many are able to decipher it any more. You do not read it like Common, but more like this - you start here ... and then it goes here... For anything more, we would need to study it using the old lexica.~
@1972 = ~Ooh, I see! That was already very interesting. Thank you for sharing your wisdom!~

/* brandock_bookrestore_eet.d */
@1973 = ~[Brandock]I can't *wait* to tell Master Elvenhair about this. - If we'll ever come back to him, that is.~
@1974 = ~[Brandock]That's *exactly* what I came here for, Master Elvenhair! Er, you remember me?... Unfortunate mage you so kindly volunteered to help some while ago with this scrumbled book that restored itself because of a spell by Master Bowgentle? - See this? This is the book! It's complete again! Er, I wrote in the spells that are inside now.~
@1975 = ~[Elvenhair]Oh, what a view for sore eyes. Beautifully done, young mage. I can tell the difference to the original, of course, but I would say you definitely restored it to its former level of power.~
@1976 = ~[Brandock]I... I thank you, Master Elvenhair. Thank you. You saying this, this-this means so much to me, you have no idea how much this means to me. I thank you so much for saying this - <CHARNAME>, let's get out of here, or I'll add "burst into tears of gratitude in front of a well-versed master" to my list of failures.~

/* c#brando_bg1end_bgt.d */
@2000 = ~<CHARNAME>, I think this is a good time to say good bye. We both reached our goals. Sarevok is stopped, and I learned a lot about wielding magic... Please understand that I need to make my way back to Amn on my own. I cannot return as a representative of Baldur's Gate authorities - I am sure you understand.~
@2001 = ~Take care, <CHARNAME>. Seeing how your path guides you to Amn, I am sure we will meet there? Who knows, maybe I'll have an influential position when next we meet - it's always good to have friends, if you are in Amn. Take care down there, will you?~

@3500 = ~(Brandock takes a deep breath.) Here we are. I said I'd do it. Anywhere... so I can as well just do it here. Here, of all places...~
@3501 = ~Well, I guess it is advantageous, because in case there *is* a fire, we can just stomp on it and noone else is being theatened, and... and...~ [c#ablank]
@3502 = ~Well, I guess it is advantageous, because in case there *is* a fire, there will be enough people around to come help extinguish it and... and...~
@3503 = ~You can do this, Brandock.~
@3504 = ~Stop babbling, that's not helpful.~
@3505 = ~Gods, is there *nothing* you can do without talking so much?~
@3506 = ~What? Oh - did I say something? Ah, yes, I was talking... to myself. I'm sorry. It's a bad habit, talking so much if feeling nervous. I know I should just stop and start scribing a scroll but it's hard for me to focus if my hands are nearly shaking and... I'm talking away again. (Brandock exhales audibly.)~
@3507 = ~You can do this, Brandock. You think you need Elvenhair, but it was you who wrote the scrolls there, not him.~
@3508 = ~I can stay here if you prefer. I can even ready this drinking pouch with water if you want me to.~

@3512 = ~(Brandock exhales.) Alright, here we go. Please don't go too far... Just in case.~
@3513 = ~I'm sorry you have to babysit me the way you do. I thank you so much, <CHARNAME>.~
@3514 = ~Here we are - one scroll of Identify. No, no scroll of Protection against Fire, you can spare me the grin. I took an easy one for my first try - my first try all alone. All alone - I did it! I *did* it, and it not only went all well, but it felt... great! I think I like writing scrolls, <CHARNAME>.~ [c#ablank]
@3515 = ~Of course you do, Brandock. I didn't expect anything else.~
@3516 = ~Excuse me while I'll be over there, laughing my ass off.~
@3517 = ~Finally. Took you long enough to overcome that stupid fear.~
@3518 = ~Subtle, <CHARNAME>. Very subtle.~
@3519 = ~Was it that obvious to you? I was dying over here!~
@3520 = ~From now on, I'll be ready to do so any time you want, anywhere you want. Well, at least everywhere it's realistic I can write on a piece of parchment, that is - you know what I mean.~
@3521 = ~I feel drained, though. I need rest... I'm so exhausted I'll be able to sleep although I'm feeling completely excited. Good night, <CHARNAME>. And, thank you - for making me do this. And in genreal - for putting up with me.~
@3522 = ~Something feels off about this protection scroll. Let's hold on to it until we have a chance to identify it.~ [c#ablank]
@3523 = ~[Brandock]A cursed scroll! I *knew* it.~ [c#ablank]
@3524 = ~[Brandock]Ugh, I can't believe anyone would go through the hassle of creating such a cursed scroll that gives so much damage to the caster. What good is it for? I feel ashamed of my fellow mages sometimes, <CHARNAME>. Such a waste of magical ressources, and what for - being able to laugh about someone else hurting themselves?~
@3525 = ~[Brandock]Even if you think you know what you are dealing with, you always need to have a sharp eye if it is magic we are talking about. Such an accursed well-done cursed scroll.~
@3526 = ~I'd like to keep it and study it more intensely when time allows, <CHARNAME>. Its magic ressources should not go to waste. Would you put it into my book case? I would like that very much.~
@3527 = ~[Elvenhair]Are you ready for a lesson in scroll scribing, young Brandock?~ [c#ablank]
@3528 = ~[Brandock]I'd *love* to, Master Elvenhair.~
@3529 = ~Sure, go ahead, Brandock.~
@3530 = ~Ah, no, we don't have time for that now.~
@3531 = ~[Elvenhair]Very well, Brandock, then let me see how much you already know. You can use this quill...~
@3532 = ~[Brandock]Er, oh - you want me to scribe one? Now? Er, of course... You will be close by, yes? I know exactly what I would like to write, if that's alright with you, of course...~
@3533 = ~[Elvenhair]Here we are - a new spell scroll, written by you, my young Brandock.~
@3534 = ~One scroll of Identify. I am sorry your skill doesn't suffice to write a scroll of Protection from Fire as you wanted originally - I wouldn't have mind either way although it would have been an unusual choice for a first try.~ [c#ablank]
@3535 = ~Protection from Fire - an unusual choice. I would have thought we'd start with a scroll of Identify, but I do not mean to question your decision.~ [c#ablank]
@3536 = ~Yes, it's, erm, it's something personal.~
@3537 = ~This was very good! Alisarhold's scholars teached you well indeed. As I said, do practice scroll scribing as much as possible. You can use my utensils any time you want. Feel free to come here and practice as often as you wish - if you can find your way around my desk, that is.~
@3538 = ~[Brandock]I thank you so much for your generosity, Master Elvenhair. I... I don't know what to say.~
@3539 = ~[Elvenhair]Ah, an old scholar like me cherishes the joys of teaching, my young friend. It makes my heart happy to see the youth being interested in books and magic! See you soon, then.~
@3540 = ~[Brandock]Farewell, Master Elvenhair. <CHARNAME>, look at this! It's a scroll of Identify. It looks like a real one! I did this!~
@3541 = ~I will be able to write more scrolls here, <CHARNAME>, once I rested. The weaker spells I can write without special ressources, but the higher spells will consume gold if written. I will be able to write more spells the more experienced I will be. I'll note it down for you so you can look the details up later.~
@3542 = ~[Brandock]Farewell, Master Elvenhair. <CHARNAME>, look at this! It's a scroll of Protection from Fire. It looks like a real one! I did this!~

@3600 = ~So, here it is - the De Simplex Magicae, with one spell. We should try whether it works as intended as soon as possible. I'm drained... I should go wash up, I'm sweated through!~ [c#ablank]
@3601 = ~This was the last page I can write for now. Here is the book.~ [c#ablank]
@3602 = ~<CHARNAME> - about the De Simplex Magicae. I know I've carried this around a lot for no appaerent reason, and it gave us - me, at least - some headaches in the past. I think, I... I think, I mean... (exhales) I think I know how to scribe spells into it now.~ [c#ablank]
@3603 = ~Per page, it'll consume one spell scroll of the wanted spell and tenth the sum in gold a normal spell scroll of the according spell would cost when writing it. Let me know if you want me to try this... You'll find me in that corner over there, having a fit of panic about my own courage.~
@3604 = ~Yes, I would *love* to try this, even though my palms are already sweaty. Let me see what I could write, hmm...~
@3605 = ~Assuming we have the appropriate scroll and gold, I could write the following spells into the De Simplex Magicae.~
@3606 = ~I only have five accessible pages in total, though, so you should chose carefully.~
@3607 = ~My ressources allow for four more spells.~
@3608 = ~My ressources allow for three more spells.~
@3609 = ~My ressources allow for two more spells.~
@3610 = ~My ressources allow only for one more spell, then all pages of the book will be full I have access to.~
@3611 = ~Fireball.~
@3612 = ~Minor Sequencer.~
@3613 = ~Breach.~

@3634 = ~Ah, maybe not today.~
@3635 = ~I will write the new spell but will leave the page open that you chose earlier. Turn the page to see the newly added spell.~
@3636 = ~With pleasure.~
@3637 = ~<CHARNAME>! Look at this! Look! (Brandock waves with a scroll, obviously excited.) It's a durable scroll of Fireball. We need to try whether this works! Er... maybe not here, though.~
@3638 = ~Fireball! You came a long way, mister "I'm so scared this could go up in flames"!~
@3639 = ~Impressive!~
@3640 = ~Well, it was expensive enough. At least this will come in handy.~
@3641 = ~Ha! Yes, that is true. And you know what? I didn't even think about it. I just thought Fireball was a pretty neat spell. If it's not against us, that is.~
@3642 = ~Thanks!~
@3643 = ~I can't make all spell scrolls work like this. The ones I can I'll happily scribe for you in the future!~
@3644 = ~I need to study this further. I am *so* close to understanding how to make a scroll that regenerates once a day.~
@3645 = ~I would like to experiment with what I have seen being used in the De Simplex Magicae. The magic behind its durability - how it was made into a book which would remain after the spells being cast, making it a source of infinite spell charges.~
@3646 = ~I have an idea how to increase durability of the scrolls - so they won't be used up after the first use. I'd need to experiment with this a bit, though - and every scroll will consume thrice the amount of a normal scroll in gold. Unless you wanted me to scribe some other scroll, of course, then this will have to wait.~
@3647 = ~Gladly. Make yourself comfortable - this could take a while.~
@3648 = ~<CHARNAME>, I'm still grabbing the concept of having completed the De Simplex Magicae. It's a real magic book of spells again - Wait! (Brandock pauses.) Wow! I could go around, telling people I wrote a magic book! Heh.~
@3649 = ~Indeed, Brandock. And a handy book it is!~
@3650 = ~I would say so, yes.~
@3651 = ~Well, if you think it's yours, try feed it to the foxes and see how far you can make yourself do it.~
@3652 = ~Having written spells back into there is not *that* impressive. There is much more you could do with this, I am sure.~
@3653 = ~Yeah, great. Let's move on.~
@3654 = ~You are right there, I couldn't... but it still feels like my work - at least partly.~
@3655 = ~It really is.~
@3656 = ~I can't believe I really restored it. I was *convinced* I'd just keep it safe until a *really* talented sage can deal with cleaning up my mess.~
@3657 = ~I'm not surprised at all, Brandock, after seeing you absorb knowledge the way you do.~
@3658 = ~You, my friend, have a serious issue with self-perception, I think.~
@3659 = ~I could watch you all day, realizing you are actually smart and a well-versed mage.~
@3660 = ~Yes, it's surprising how daft some really intelligent people can be.~
@3661 = ~I sense a compliment in there... somewhere.~
@3662 = ~You know me better than I do sometimes, it seems.~
@3663 = ~I know it wasn't "simple" like scribing a normal scroll. I indeed gathered a lot of knowledge to be able to complete it. I mean... I know I'm not the same young man staring at magic for the first time any more, but I don't *feel* any different - I still don't feel like I'd know much, it still thrills me to learn about it, and its full potential still scares me.~
@3664 = ~But for making a magic book of spells, it was simple enough as a prestudy. Suddenly, I'm holding what I'd call a magic book, and I learned quite a bit on my way here. I feel proud and humble at the same time - as every so often.~
@3665 = ~Of course, but I'm still trying to grasp the way I came so far.~
@3666 = ~We don't have to talk about it if you don't feel like it.~
@3667 = ~I'm not sure what I'll do with all this knowledge yet - other than I'll write own books, once these times of madness will be over and the gods will grant me a quiet life. What I do know is that I will feel responsible for this knowledge not getting into the wrong hands.~
@3668 = ~Oh, look at this book - it makes casting spells possible for anyone!... This... this is even more powerful than the De Simplex Magicae! I need to study this...~
@3669 = ~Don't drool on it, please.~
@3670 = ~Anything you could learn from that?~
@3671 = ~Yeah, right, just take the book right out of my hands to look at it yourself. I can wait.~
@3672 = ~Oh, I'm sorry, it's just - I'll be quick.~
@3673 = ~I was studying the Book of Infinite Spells, <CHARNAME>. This looks like a book from Bowgentle, actually. I wonder whether it also has such a safety feature as the De Simplex Magicae had! This would be a great specimen to test a theory of mine. <CHARNAME>, can I subject this book to some destruction experim... - (Brandock's face splits into a wide grin.) Dang it, I knew I couldn't fool you. I can never hold my grin when I try!~
@3674 = ~(smile) You are an honest person through and through, Brandock, and it's one of the things I like about you.~
@3675 = ~You did have me there for a very short moment, Brandock. Before you started grinning, of course.~
@3676 = ~Do you really think this is a laughing matter? What came out of the destroyed De Simplex Magicae surely went to your head, it seems.~
@3677 = ~I don't care. Study the book if you want, but do so in silence.~
@3678 = ~[Brandock]I was jesting, of course. I would indeed never destroy a book on purpose - unless I'd know *exactly* what I'm doing. (mumbles) Which I usually don't. At least often...~
@3679 = ~[Brandock]I do hope you'll let me study this in earnest, though.~
@3680 = ~I'm glad you see it that way. Most people called me a spoilsport.~
@3681 = ~Hmm... not as well explained as the De Simplex Magicae, though. It focuses on the practical use of throwing the spells. And the magic of the book restricts only random pages being opened, without the possibility to scroll back.~
@3682 = ~That's a very good safety feature. It makes people careful and teaches them how precious this magic is - I guess.~
@3683 = ~Please, don't add this "feature" to any books you will be writing. It's too random.~
@3684 = ~I'd rather it would work like a normal book where pages can be turned at will.~
@3685 = ~I think it's completely unnecessary and restricts the usage of this book for no obvious reasons.~
@3686 = ~Once the last page is reached we'll be stuck with whatever spell it holds. All others will be lost forever! How can you find excuses for such a restriction?~
@3687 = ~Safety feature? I think the mage who implemented this thought they were really funny. Or liked being sadistic.~
@3688 = ~I think it is very restrictive. But it would be far too powerful if all pages could be opened at will.~
@3689 = ~Did you find out anything?~
@3690 = ~Are you saying such a book could be written where I could scroll back and forth?~
@3691 = ~Not this book, not like it is now, no. Not me, anyway. As much as it would interest me to know more about it...~
@3692 = ~That said, I believe I could do... *something* with this book. Seeing the magic behind the De Simplex Magicae teached me a lot of things. I think it should be possible to mark the pages - so that the ones opened could be reopened again.~
@3693 = ~Could you rewrite this book so the pages can be turned freely?~
@3694 = ~This book with pages so they could be turned both ways would make the book incradibly poweful. Imagine such a book in the wrong hands!~
@3695 = ~I would prefer to have such a book.~
@3696 = ~I agree that it is already a powerful magic item.~
@3697 = ~I admit all knowledge I so far gathered is that I'll never be able to write something like this - unless I dedicate myself to study the arts of making magic books at Candlekeep or Alisarhold. It is a very powerful book, even with the restriction of pages being closed forwever. I wonder who wrote it - I think making it restricted like this is a rather sensible thing to do. *Or* someone with a lot of power had a lot of fun when doing it.~
@3698 = ~Is that a question?! YES!~
@3699 = ~I sense it's not done, though. There is still one empty page, but I can't do anything with it yet. I need more experience before I can write a spell onto it, I guess.~
@3700 = ~<CHARNAME>, the incredible happened - the last page of the De Simplex Magicae opened up for me. Let me know what you want me to write on it!~
@3701 = ~That ... might be true. Or the weel-known sage would have been busy with other, more important stuff. - You do understand that I wanted to finish this myself, though? Fix what I broke?~
@3702 = ~Well, seems you were sufficient, in the end.~
@3703 = ~It might have gone a lot quicker if you had, you know.~
//@3704 = ~##~
//@3705 = ~##~
//@3706 = ~##~
@3707 = ~The thought of such spells in the hands of non-magic skilled people is already frightening enough... and... so fascinating. Absolutely fascinating. How did they do that?...~
@3708 = ~Here he goes again. Let me know when you're back to this conversation.~
@3709 = ~Oh - *lots*, I hope!~
//@3710 = ~##~
@3711 = ~Can you do anything with this knowledge?~
@3712 = ~I'll leave you to it, then. Maybe you'll be able to learn something from it for your own work.~
@3713 = ~What? Oh.~
@3714 = ~I don't care about that book, Brandock.~
@3715 = ~It's similar to the magic spell we got as a reward from Thalantyr's bookshelf... This sounds even weirder when spoken out loud.~
@3716 = ~This is *most* fascinating. It uses the wisdom from the De Simplex Magicae, to some extend. And at the same time surpasses it in its implementation... I won't be able to write scrolls that work that way - not anytime soon, anyway.~
@3717 = ~A pity it is already at the last page. I'd have liked to see the other spell pages...~
@3718 = ~Ah - I'm still unsure this is a good idea, but - do you want me to do that?~
@3719 = ~Yes, please.~
@3720 = ~No, leave the book as it is.~
@3721 = ~I'll study the book some more when we'll find the time. Whoever wrote this knew exactly what they were doing...~
@3722 = ~Alright. This is how this will work: First I need you to scroll through the book. Any page you'll open I will mark so I can scroll back to it. Once you reach the last page I'll fix the markings so all of those pages can be reopened again like in a normal book. This is all I can offer. I can't force pages open that won't show by itself.~
@3723 = ~I already marked the first page with the spell "Fireball" on it.~
@3724 = ~I already marked the page with the spell "Invisibility" on it.~
@3725 = ~I already marked the page with the spell "Protection From Evil" on it.~
@3726 = ~I already marked the page with the spell "True Seeing" on it.~
@3727 = ~I already marked the page with the spell "Farsight" on it.~
@3728 = ~I already marked the page with the spell "Spell Turning" on it.~
@3729 = ~I already marked the page with the spell "Wyvern Call" on it.~
@3730 = ~I already marked the page with the spell "Stinking Cloud" on it.~
@3731 = ~I already marked the page with the spell "Lightning Bolt" on it.~
@3732 = ~Once you opened a new page, give me a little time before turning the next one. I'll let you know when I'm done. I won't comment on pages we already saw.~
@3733 = ~As you wish.~
@3734 = ~"Burning Hands". This sems to be the last page. Give me a moment...~
@3735 = ~Here it is - you should be able to reopen all pages we just saw. Please keep this on a low profile... I'm a bit scared of what I did there.~

@3900 = ~[Drunkard]Hey, its you! Didn't you sort all the glasses and bottles in the shelf in the Elfsong Tavern recently? That was hilarious! Especially when the bartender wanted to throw you out and you turned into a half-ogre and just let him dangle from your outstretched arm! I thought you would smash the place when the Watch arrived, but you just seemed puzzled about how you turned into a half-ogre in the first place. So, they let you out of prison already, eh? Well, take care, yes?~
@3901 = ~[Brandock]Er... me? <CHARNAME>, I *swear* I have no idea what he is t... oh. Lanky guy, dark hair, looks like me to a fault - and apparently can turn into a half-ogre again? Alright. <CHARNAME>, that's definitely Malm, my half-ogre "twin brother". Please let us check whether he needs any assistance. He seems to be in prison! He must be *devastated*!~
@3902 = ~Wait, how did you get out already? I thought... Oh, you are not Malm, although you two look very alike!~ [c#ablank]
@3903 = ~I was about to say! You look just like Malm we had to take in recently.~ [c#ablank]
@3904 = ~Indeed! We are here to talk to Malm, my, er, cousin! Is there anything we can do to make you release him?~
@3905 = ~You could pay a release fee, but it wouldn't be fair to take it from you - he's about to be released shortly anyway. We locked him in the cell to sober up, basically, since he didn't hurt anyone - other than the bartender's pride, I guess. Just go down the aisle.~
@3906 = ~[Half-Ogre]I know you, you are Brandock's friends. Brandock here also?~
@3907 = ~Hello! I came to big city. There are so many people! - Malm does not feel well...~
@3908 = ~Malm! Malm, I am *so* sorry. You will get you out of there soon. Did they mistreat you in any way? Did they hurt you? Did you, erm, hurt someone?... I heard you could shift into a half-ogre again!~
@3909 = ~Noone hurt Malm, and Malm hurt noone - I think. I drank - sweet bitter thing that makes head spin. They say Malm turned to half-ogre but I can't really remember. Now head hurts!~
@3910 = ~Oh! So you mean your head hurts because you drank too much... Yes, I'm sorry to say so, but you chose the wrong template for a career in inn hopping. So you still can't shift at will? But don't be afraid, we will get you out of the prison! This must be devastating for you - so many people, and the hostility, and being imprisoned, and...~
@3911 = ~Oh, Malm isn't afraid. Malm likes people around. They gave me little secure room to sleep. Without wanting gold!~
@3912 = ~[Brandock]Er... really? I mean... oh. Alright, that's a good thing then! Wow. We are nothing alike... at least not in this regard.~
@3913 = ~So, Malm. All sobered up? For someone who can turn into a half-ogre you are a really nice chap to have around. Be careful out there, yes?~ [c#ablank]
@3914 = ~Malm will go back into city. There is so much to see! But I will stay away from sweet-bitter and bitter-bitter liquids that make head spin. Didn't like that at all.~
@3915 = ~Malm, such a big city is not a good place for you. People are not good with other people who are too curious... and also too old for having what I'd call the 'childhood bonus'. You'd need to spend time at a place that does teaching for a living, so to say. Maybe... a big library. Like Alisarhold!~
@3916 = ~I still have friends there. I am sure they would love to study you and the magic that transformed us, too. And oh - if you are searching for a cure to Thalantyr's magic so you'll be able to shift into a half-ogre as long as you want again - that's the right place to go. Let me write you a recommendation letter...~
@3917 = ~Only question is how you'll get there. I can give you gold and a map with directions, but what if you get into danger along the way? Wait - I'm constantly forgetting I am talking to a half-ogre - who is not afraid of people. You will be fine. As long as you do not turn into a half-ogre if people are around, alright? That is really important, if you'll go south.~
@3918 = ~I can't shift when sober, I tried. So, no half-ogre unless Brandock's friends at library can help. Malm will go there.~
@3919 = ~Ask at a temple whether they know about caravans going south. There should be a lot of travelling nowadays. Say hello to my friends - I am sure they'll be happy to get a librarian who will be strong enough to move shelves on his own, haha! Take care, Malm.~
@3920 = ~Did I... did I just send Malm - a half-ogre trapped in a weak human body - on a thousand miles journey into a magic hating land he doesn't know anything about and where he knows noone?~
@3921 = ~I think you did, yes.~
@3922 = ~What were you thinking?!~
@3923 = ~You think the sages will take him on?~
@3924 = ~I doubt your friends in Alisarhold will be pleased about having to babysit a half-ogre, wild magic yes or no.~
@3925 = ~He'll be fine. He found his way around Beregost and up to the big city on his own, as well!~
@3926 = ~If he'll manage that I'd say he's fit for the world of people alright.~
@3927 = ~That was a really stupid idea, Brandock. He'll never make it.~
@3928 = ~Brandock - I understand the sentiment, but Malm is still a half-ogre. Without all this, we would have faught and killed him without thinking twice.~
@3929 = ~Do you want to accompany him or what is your point?~
@3930 = ~Is this settled? Great, because I'd love to get going.~
@3931 = ~Oh, boy...~
@3932 = ~Yes, but think about where we found him...~
@3933 = ~If they still are anything like when I was there, they will be interested.~
@3934 = ~That might be true, but things *did* happen, and I feel responsible.~
@3935 = ~Oh, dear. I hope I won't have to add this to my bad consciousness. Please, gods - let him be alright, and not learn about magic in Amn the hard way... and don't let him meet any foxes.~
@3936 = ~No, even I realize that that would be too much, with or without feeling responsible.~
