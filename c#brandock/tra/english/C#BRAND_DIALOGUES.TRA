@0  = ~I grew up in the greatest library of Faerûn, you know.~
@1    = ~Necromancy! I don't like it. We have to take that madman down quickly, <CHARNAME>, or his sceletons will take down us.~
@2    = ~Wait, what? Poisoned? When, how ... what?!~
@3    = ~To atone for an unwanted murder of your own family. I do not envy you, Captain Brage. Not at all. Your path will be a hard one...~
@4    = ~Do not call me captain. I shamed and lost that title forever. My poor family...~
@5    = ~Wow, I can't believe we really defeated your 'half-brother'. Hm. The way that Sarevok was shocked when you stroke him down... So much disbelief. He really didn't expect this to happen, it seems. I felt a little sorry for him. A little. Almost. Well, not really.~
@6    = ~<CHARNAME>, those might be only snippets and pieces but the remains of that book really mean a lot to me. We need to go back and collect them as soon as possible.~
@7    = ~<CHARNAME>, that book really means a lot to me. We need to go back and collect it as soon as possible.~
@8    = ~<CHARNAME>, I asked you to return so we could collect my book. This did not happen so I'll have to go searching for it myself. Farewell.~
@9    = ~To be on look-out for an assassination victim in a tavern is understandable. But to *attack* inside the tavern surely speaks of a high self opinion concerning your fighting prowess. (waves his arms) That man *attacked* us inside a tavern! And *no one* cares! I think I could use a drink. If only I would. Drink, I mean. (sigh).~ [c#ablank]
@10   = ~Hm, Nashkel is Amnish soil, <CHARNAME>. Having trouble in the mine - magic trouble, as it seems, surely is of high interest to the Cowled Wizards.~ [c#ablank]
@11   = ~The Cowled Wizards are the official organization of Amnish mages, as you probably know. They are very powerful... very powerful.~
@12   = ~I'm just saying... This would be of interest to me, too. Helping to clear the mines surely will give us bonus points with the Cowled Wizards. Bonus points with them are always good.~
@13   = ~Well, what am I saying? Of course they care, considering they sent a Cowled Wizard here to investigate...~
@14   = ~Well, yes, we are most definitely a long way from Athkatla, Amnish soil or no. Having magic thrown inside a tavern like this without *anyone* taking notice is so definitely *not* Amnish.~ [c#ablank]
@15   = ~Being ambushed by an assassin is, though.~
@16   = ~Although I am surprised by the determination in which she was looking for *you*.~
@17   = ~Must be because of these nice pictures of you some people are carrying around...~
@18   = ~I do start to get used to that...~
@19   = ~What a nightmare! My sincerest condolesces.~
@20   = ~(mumbles) Didn't I speak of exactly *that*? (sigh)~
@21   = ~Thank you. (sniff)~
@22   = ~(mumbles) Oh gods, do *I* sound like him?~
@23   = ~The tainted ore stops at *no one*, as it seems.~
@24   = ~There you go - iron gear broke. I hope you have enough in stock, because this sight is just too depressing.~
@25   = ~Wait - that could be the ogre who is camping in front of the cave where I located my belongings! Two birds, one stone, right?~
@26   = ~Balduran's...?! Balduran's ship wreck! What a thrilling thought. Travelling with you is getting better and better. Imagine what we could learn!~
@27   = ~Stealing... I am not fond of stealing. I hope there is another way to retrieve these sea chards.~
@28   = ~(whispers) A witness to Balduran's last days... <CHARNAME>, please let this man tell his tale!~
@29   = ~Perhaps you should tell us your tale.~
@30   = ~Are we really stranded on this island? Like, *stranded*? Like, no ship for leaving, and... and no shipbuilder, and probably not enough wood, and... (inhales)~ [c#ablank]
@31   = ~Calm yourself, Brandock. I'm sure there must be a way off this island. There always is.~
@32   = ~Look, there is even a town nearby. All will be well.~
@33   = ~I'm as shocked as you, but we'll have to make the best of it.~
@34   = ~We don't know that yet, do we?~
@35   = ~Shut up, Brandock.~
@36   = ~I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. I am sorry... I need to be frantic for just a little longer, but I promise I will be quiet about it.~
@37   = ~Gods. To be trapped in a hostile surrounding, *and* losing one's spellbook. What a nightmare. I can't help but sympathize with trapped mages. Trapped, magicless mages! I lack a lack of empathy in this regard, so to say. (shivers)~ [c#ablank]
@38   = ~And here I was, being so happy that *this* time we wouldn't meet trapped mages like there were on the ice island. Considering we don't have a way home, at least *this* could have been different? No?...~
@39   = ~That we killed him doesn't make it better. No...~
@40   = ~I didn't mean to be rude back there, but why would a mage go on such an expedition and leave his spellbook in his cabin?~
@41   = ~Funny how he survived all these years so we could meet him now...~
@42   = ~Yes, good thing *we* didn't get stranded on an island full of hostile lycanthropes. Oops...~
@43   = ~A horrible thought, indeed.~
@44   = ~I am more troubled by our own fate.~
@45   = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, that *is* rude. Everyone is smarter after it happened. I guess he suffered enough in the meantime to make up for his foolishness.~
@46   = ~But I do appreciate you didn't say it to his face. Seemed a bit on edge, the good elf.~
@47   = ~Maybe you could have asked him that, instead of provoking him to a fight-to-death.~
@48   = ~But honestly... I am surprised as well.~
@49   = ~Hm? Are we getting a bit self-centered? I am sure he wasn't placed by the gods onto this island so *we* could ask about Balduran's last days. He was lucky when the fighting started, and he is an elf, so he outlived any other survivors. ...Alone. (shivers again)~
@50   = ~(moans) I am trying hard not to think about that detail, <CHARNAME>.~
@51   = ~All I can say is - from now on, I'll take my spell book wherever I go. Everywhere. Maybe not inside a bathtub. But definitely when I go... behind the bushes, you know. I mean it!~
@52   = ~Ooooh, the last possible eye witness of Balduran, and we had to kill him! ... Did we really, <CHARNAME>?~ [c#ablank]
@53   = ~Balduran's Logbook!~ [c#ablank]
@54   = ~Could I?... Could I have it, just for a short moment?~
@55   = ~This is it! It describes his last moments. Up to the point where he still found the time to write, of course. The pages are old and worn, we need to treat this with care. And...~
@56   = ~The History of the Nether Scrolls. What a magnificent book!~ [c#ablank]
@57   = ~Could I?...~
@58   = ~I do confess I don't understand a word. But it's an honor to even hold this.~
@59   = ~(inhales) This... (Whispers, still staring at the book.) This is a 10,000 gold book. Oh - my - gods. <CHARNAME>? <CHARNAME>?! Take this out of my hands, please? You put this somewhere safe. Preferably somewhere far away from me. Before... before *something* happens!~
@60   = ~Er, Ajantis? You so kindly promised. Would you... would you take it, please?!~
@61   = ~Ajantis?...~
@62   = ~And I will put this back veeeery carefully...~
@63   = ~Whut - no, nono. <CHARNAME>, you take this book away from me. You can't consider me taking care of this valuable book? Not seriously? I mean...~ [c#ablank]
@64   = ~(sigh) Thank you for your trust... I guess.~
@65   = ~Phew, that should cure our risk of turning into a werewolf!~ [c#ablank]
@66   = ~Er, ours, that is. Yours probably not.~
@67   = ~I held my tongue back there on that island, we were busy fighting. But I was quite at unease considering the situation. I have no intention of adding lycantrophy to the list of my misfortunes... Although... I already kind of *did*?~
@68   = ~I am glad we won't be changing into this. Very glad.~
@69   = ~No offense.~
@70   = ~Well, it was an unexpected adventure to be sure.~
@71   = ~As you said, I went through all this and made use of it.~
@72   = ~I am glad it's over, too.~
@73   = ~What can I say - 'Balduran's Logbook'!~
@74   = ~Yes, I got it. It's over, so let's go.~
@75   = ~But what were we thinking. Who was he, to receive Balduran's Logbook? I was so eager to read through it, myself, to think any further than my own nose. No more 'expeditions' from people we hardly know and have a shady appearance, <CHARNAME>, promise? Leave it to shiny members of well-known authorities to trick us in the future.~
@76   = ~Oh, yes!~
@77   = ~A... a magic isle, full of trapped mages that were drawn here... I really thought this was a joke. Well, not a joke as in jesting, but something not real. You know, fictitious.~ [c#ablank]
@78   = ~I can imagine that this can be quite frightening for a mage.~
@79   = ~I agree, this is really frightening.~
@80   = ~Where have you heard about it?~
@81   = ~Seems quite real to me...~
@82   = ~I don't want to talk about it.~
@83   = ~Oh yes! It is, indeed.~
@84   = ~Then I will be quiet. Just let me tell you that I might have happened to end up here... If my first teacher wouldn't have stopped me in time from performing a teleportation spell I didn't know *was* one.~
@85   = ~It all comes back so promptly. I haven't thought about this detail in years! And now my knees are shaking, because I realize he could have saved me. I know chances are low I'd teleported across the sea, but still... The thought of being trapped here... Probably crazy like these poor chaps, really shatters me!~
@86   = ~Good we have a way back! I mean... we *do* have a way back, yes?...~
@87   = ~<CHARNAME>, you know, I am not much better than this Melicamp apprentice of Thalantyr was.~
@88   = ~No, I am not referring to whatever happened while trying to help poor chicken Melicamp! Although I do see that this description would fit there, too.~
@89   = ~It was before I was magically trained, and my master stopped me just in time. He wasn't my master then, because I experimented with my magic powers before anyone actually realized what was going on, but he took me on soon enough.~
@90   = ~I already told you about this - the runes in my teacher's bag. What I didn't tell you is the spell on the rune I was reading.~
@91   = ~It was teleportation magic! Teleportation, you see? I still see that look on his face when he wrenched the then glowing rune out of my hands...~
@92   = ~I do wonder about my first teacher, <CHARNAME>. Since we talked about him while visiting, I mean, 'visiting', the Ice Island, I can't help but to think of him. There are things I forgot... or tried to ignore, more likely. Something that feels wrong, thinking about it now.~ [c#ablank]
@93   = ~What do you mean?~
@94   = ~Was he mean to you?~
@95   = ~I am not interested in this.~
@96   = ~Only three months after he took me on, I was transferred to a Cowled Wizard for training. A lot of them came to our house, all hooded in their brownish cloaks, and they said to my teacher he had to leave - and he just nodded.~
@97   = ~They told me my first teacher had to leave on urgent business and to pack my things. I was told to hush when I asked what the business was. They said to seek an apprenticeship with a real mage since I was old enough, as that's how it's done in Amn.~
@98   = ~Meaning your first teacher wasn't official?~
@99   = ~But you think there was something wrong?~
@100  = ~Sounds like the official procedure, then.~
@101  = ~Know what - forget I asked. I don't want to hear more about your first teacher.~
@102  = ~No! Absolutely not. Think patient, think friendly, but also strict, and you have a good picture of him.~
@103  = ~You have a sharp mind. It took me years to come to this conclusion - in this very moment, actually.~
@104  = ~Definitely.~
@105  = ~Official, yes, but how does my first teacher fit into this?~
@106  = ~Thinking about him now, I have the impression he was expecting something to happen. You know, this nervousness some people radiate that you only notice afterwards, like a bad foreshadowing. The funny thing is that I didn't realize it, not even after I got transferred. It all comes back to me now.~
@107  = ~I am sorry to bore you with this, but it is really making my head spin, currently.~
@108  = ~I always wondered why he would have to go with the Cowled Wizards. But it is *now* that I realize he most probably was forced to leave because he might have been in trouble! He could have been in trouble for teaching me, maybe he did it without accreditation by the Cowled Wizards, and they found out! The thought alone worries me.~
@109  = ~Ah, I could go on about this, but I know we have more important things to do.~
@110  = ~You definitely do not sleep well lately, <CHARNAME>. And... you waking up in a glowing aura kind of adds some creepiness, I have to admit. What is going on?~ [c#ablank]
@111  = ~I have bad dreams - dreams of a foreboding kind.~
@112  = ~I have nightmares, but I don't know what is going on.~
@113  = ~It's alright, nothing to worry about.~
@114  = ~The ways of the gods are mysterious. Maybe one of them chose you and is trying to get in contact, who knows. I'll be here, in case it's something else.~
@115  = ~Well, I have a suspicion of what is causing this. Godly blood has influence over you somehow. I'll be here, in case it'll boil too hot.~
@116  = ~By the Gods. I know I wanted to train my magic abilities, but this fight was pointless! What a powerful mage. What a waste of talent... What was it again why he attacked us?~ [c#ablank]
@117  = ~But I will definitely have a look into his spell book. Something good has to come out of this...~
@118  = ~Oh... I... need to move slowly. Slowly... Ma-ma-maybe a rest would be good, soon.~ [c#ablank]
@119  = ~Ooooh, I will *so* regret this tomorrow.~ [c#ablank]
@120  = ~<CHARNAME>, I'd rather you wouldn't have me do this. I think being drunk is a bit (hiccup) humililililating.~ [c#ablank]
@121  = ~Ah. I just saw too many good people ruining themselves with too much ale, you know. But I'm not saying this doesn't taste well, oh no.~ [c#ablank]
@122  = ~Oh... I think that was one too many. Because, I think, if I see everything twice, tha-tha-that's one time too many.~ [c#ablank]
@123  = ~I shouldn't do this, <CHARNAME>. Not after what happened last time.~ [c#ablank]
@124  = ~Cells! And so many. How charming. Entering the headquarters through the cells. How fitting. Bring the citizens into line without doing much, huh? Or, demonstrating what the Flaming Fist are for. Or, that working here is all about duty! 'Stand away, citizen!'~ [c#ablank]
@125  = ~I have a bad feeling standing between all these cells. I feel ... threatened. I guess that is what happens if you grow up being a mage in Amn.~
@126  = ~Ah, a carnival... yes, they look the same everywhere, I guess. I spent quite some time on one myself, performing. With the blessing of the city's officials, of course. The pay was quite good, considering the circumstances.~ [c#ablank]
@127  = ~I had to save for a lot of gold to realize my plans...~
@128  = ~Still pondering about that poor Captain and his berserker sword... To kill ones own family while under such an evil influence. What a thought. What a horrible, awful, *terrorising* thought.~ [c#ablank]
@129  = ~I wonder if the righteousness, the friendly, the steadfast, fall prey to such magic easier? Is the effect of corruption stronger for the murderous ones? Imagine an evil blackguard, full of lust for the slaughter taking up such a weapon. Would anyone even *notice*?~
@130  = ~Hm, good question.~
@131  = ~What a tasteless remark, Brandock. I am sure the captain's family *noticed* all right.~
@132  = ~'Hey! I am a cursed weapon! It's me, doing the slaughtering! Not that damned blackguard!'~
@133  = ~I never imagined life can go wrong for cursed weapons, too.~
@134  = ~I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. I'm just shocked by what happened. It keeps turning in my head and my mind starts producing these thoughts... to distract me from these horrors.~
@135  = ~The Sorcerous Sundries! I heard about this so, *so* far away. I have to go in there and take a peak at the magic wares at some point, <CHARNAME>. Pleeeeeeeeeease!~ [c#ablank]
@136  = ~Wow! This is ... wow! Look over there, it's a ... wow! ...~ [c#ablank]
@137  = ~I think I'll need to catch my breath before we do the actual trade with the shop keeper. My head feels like it's going to *explode*.~
@138  = ~Oh, dang, <CHARNAME>. He didn't make it. I was so hoping for a happy ending.~ [c#ablank]
@139  = ~Doppelgangers! Of *course*!~ [c#ablank]
@140  = ~The ghosts in Nashkel Mine turn out to be a small part of a bigger, criminal organization. And we just poked into the wasps nest, as it seems. Something tells me that angry wasps would be preferable to what we *will* stirr up... But, yes, I am at your side to go on with these investigations, <CHARNAME>.~ [c#ablank]
@141  = ~To taint the ore. The ore! What a foul play. What is it for? What use do breakable weapons have? Apart from the obvious one, if it is your enemy who has them, of course. Gods, I could go on about this...~ [c#ablank]
@142  = ~A connection to the bandits! This is intriguing, <CHARNAME>. Intriguing and highly frightening... I suppose we will go there, yes? Well, yes. What else will shed more light onto this!~ [c#ablank]
@143  = ~And I will have a quick glance into this man's spell book, while we are at it.~
@144  = ~Aaaaand again, we are looking for the higher level of organization. The evil overlord! Well... let's go!~ [c#ablank]
@145  = ~Just in case anyone was about to ask, yes, I am frightened as hell.~
@146  = ~Er, nice picture. Of ... you. They didn't quite get the nose right, though? Sorry for making jokes about this, <CHARNAME>. This is serious matter.~ [c#ablank]
@147  = ~G... Gorion? Wait - <CHARNAME>... from Candlekeep?! How can I be so *daft*? Of course you are <CHARNAME>, Gorion's foster child. What do you... what do you mean, "tried" to protect you? Are you saying...?~
@148  = ~You knew about Gorion and me? How so?~
@149  = ~Gorion died when we got into an ambush.~
@150  = ~He's dead, Brandock.~
@151  = ~Why would you care?~
@152  = ~Seems like someone wants you dead, indeed? You don't have, by a chance, any idea who that would be?~
@153  = ~No, I don't.~
@154  = ~Well, Gorion tried to protect me from something, or someone...~
@155  = ~This being connected to you leaving Candlekeep, and Gorion being killed... This is not a threat to be trifled with.~
@156  = ~I have the impression that by traveling with you, I'll have more training possibilities to increase my magical prowess than I was actually expecting. Which is not a bad thing, per se. Just a bit... disturbing.~
@157  = ~I'm... I'm sorry, this was a tasteless remark, considering your situation. I said I will help you if you help me, and that didn't change. I'm not going to bail out just because it's getting serious!~
@158  = ~What? Who wouldn't have known Gorion, the wise sage and powerful wizard, residing in Candlekeep? I mean, what *mage* wouldn't!~
@159  = ~Who?~
@160  = ~No, no, Xzar, I don't believe you mean that!~
@161  = ~Or monk. Or adventurer. Or - everyone? Well, I didn't knew him personally, of course, and about you I don't know much, well, nothing, to be honest, besides your name - and that only because you are foster child to Gorion.~
@162  = ~Please tell me... Is it true?~
@163  = ~What personal reasons?~
@164  = ~I seek wisdom, <CHARNAME>, and Candlekeep is the place to go for that on the Sword Coast. I'll tell you all about my plans if you want, but right now...~
@165  = ~I thank you.~
@166  = ~Let's get moving.~
@167  = ~I was... I was keenly interested in Gorion and Candlekeep, <CHARNAME>, for my personal reasons.~
@168  = ~So it *is* true? It really happened? Gods... And here I am, making jokes about bounty notes. I had no idea, <CHARNAME>! I am so sorry for your loss!~
@169  = ~You see why I wanted help, Brandock.~
@170  = ~I don't know much about you, besides your name. I was interested in Gorion, mainly. I didn't knew him personally, of course, but who wouldn't have known Gorion, the wise sage and powerful wizard, residing in Candlekeep?~
@171  = ~Let's go on and make sure whoever it is doesn't get a hand on you. Or us. Or... me. Ahem.~
@172  = ~I... I definitely do, yes.~
@173  = ~You have no idea who would be after you?~
@174  = ~No. Let's get moving.~
@175  = ~As much as I understand the sentinent - from your perspective, that is, I beg you to consider that I am bound to you, and probably doomed with you, now that we are travelling together.~
@176  = ~You'll learn soon enough.~
@177  = ~This was never a good approach, <CHARNAME>. Never. Better share the info, and not let us walk into our doom. ...Please!~
@178  = ~Wow... what happened here? Look at all the traces of fierce, destructive magic!~ [c#ablank]
@179  = ~Is it ... is it here that Gorion died? The traces of the fight are still visible, even after the time that passed! The magic inflicted here surely was mighty ...~
@180  = ~Yep, that's the spot. Poor Gorion...~
@181  = ~Yes, that's the place where it happened.~
@182  = ~I don't want to talk about it, Brandock.~
@183  = ~This must have been a heavy fight, if there are traces still visible.~
@184  = ~I know what happened here... but <CHARNAME> should tell you <PRO_HIMHER>self!~
@185  = ~Gorion and I were ambushed here.~
@186  = ~The traces are from Gorion's magic, Brandock.~
@187  = ~Whatever, it's past.~
@188  = ~That it definitely is.~
@189  = ~Ahh, come on, <CHARNAME>! Oh well, I guess you will learn with time, Brandock.~
@190  = ~<CHARNAME>, if whoever ambushed Gorion and you gets hold of us any time soon, I promise you, I promise you, I'll probably die a spectacular death. Fighting at your side, I mean.~
@191  = ~G... Gorion? Wait - <CHARNAME>... from Candlekeep?! How can I be so *daft*? Of course you are <CHARNAME>, Gorion's foster child. What do you... what do you mean, Gorion had to fight? Are you saying...?~
@192  = ~How would you know about me?~
@193  = ~He is dead? He is really dead?~
@194  = ~Then I must assume that it is true... Gorion is dead...~
@195  = ~Gods, <CHARNAME>, and here I am, marvelling at the traces of powerful magics, while you lost your father, your home... I am sorry for your loss!~
@196  = ~It's alright. Let's move on.~
@197  = ~I am glad I can be of service. I really mean it.~
@198  = ~Hm, Thalantyr is a great mage. Very peculiar, but great. And wise, and known. Had I not lost my reputation as a mage by destroying the book, I could ask him to take me on as an apprentice...~ [c#ablank]
@199  = ~Argh, what nonsense! Had I not destroyed that book I'd be in Candlekeep now!...~
@200  = ~Is it over *now*? Wow, that was... impressive. Did you see the way that mage hopped through the rooms at the beginning of the fight?~ [c#ablank]
@201  = ~(scoff) Did he? I hardly noticed!~
@202  = ~Of course!~
@203  = ~Yeah, looked like wild magic. I've heard you can achieve woundrous things using wild magic!~
@204  = ~What? Oh, yeah. Very funny, <CHARNAME>.~
@205  = ~I have to stay a minute or two and have a look at his books. Please, <CHARNAME>? Only a few minutes.~
@206  = ~Yes, but be careful. There could be traps around, still.~
@207  = ~No, Brandock. I need us all to be ready and on alert in case there are more enemies around.~
@208  = ~Ah, that make sense... Dang.~
@209  = ~I will. I'll be right over there!~
@210  = ~(sigh) Don't judge me, <CHARNAME>, but I have to say it... Davaeorn was a great mage. With apprentices. An evil man, but a great mage. I am used to evil mages. But - nah, I went away from evil mages to leave this behind. Alright, let us move on. Nothing to see here. And he is dead, anyway.~ [c#ablank]
@211  = ~Doppelgangers. Doppelgangers! I hate it if they work organized. Why are they here?~ [c#ablank]
@212  = ~Secret mines! Secret mines, now *that* makes sense. Taint the official ore, use and sell good one yourself, from a secret mine. Oh, and blame everything onto the neighboring lands and rise a war. Who would play little, if he can play big?~ [c#ablank]
@213  = ~Hm, considering I joined your forces to gain experience and reputation for the position I had in mind, the current situation somehow fails to satisfy me in this regard.~ [c#ablank]
@214  = ~(sigh) And it worked so well until now! For a moment, I really felt like we were saving the Sword Coast... Now I'm not even sure we can save ourselves.~
@215  = ~But we are! Just give me time to work this out.~
@216  = ~Why, I think 'being arrested for murder' would be something you still needed to add to your list of failures.~
@217  = ~Believe me, I'm not satisfied either.~
@218  = ~Is that an accusation? What would you have me do?~
@219  = ~Not our fault that the evil organization we are trying to expose took over half of the land, is it?~
@220  = ~Of course I know they do us wrong. And gods know I do not blame you for anything that's happening.~
@221  = ~But we need to get out of here first. Then we have to convince the authorities we aren't the murderers they think we are or that someone wants us to appear to be. I'd appreciate starting soon, because this is going to be a hell of a task.~
@222  = ~Hm. Ouch.~
@223  = ~Er, <CHARNAME>, are we to enter Durlag's Tower? I heard tales about it when I was young. Stories of unthinkable riches, traps, monsters and the adventurers who went in and never found their way out.~ [c#ablank]
@224  = ~Just saying.~
@225  = ~(sigh) Poor people. Doppelgangers infiltrating the family clan! A home, invided by doppelgangers, slowly taking over the population, the remaining going mad in their despair and terror. This tower tells of a terrifying, and also very, very sad story.~ [c#ablank]
@226  = ~This is *the* manifestation of a nightmare, in my opinion. To have your family members replaced by doppelgangers! I think doppelgangers are the most horrible monsters in these realms. Right there with vampires, werewolves, phase spiders, zombies, Ghouls, dragons, demons...~
@227  = ~I hope you are holding up alright, <CHARNAME>. After what we saw in Candlekeep...~
@228  = ~I *also* think the whole tower is quite scary. You know, what I said when we were still outside...~
@229  = ~Wow, I never thought going with you would turn out like this. You know, ending the bandit threat, which was a great achievement in itself. Stopping the spread of that cursed tainted ore - I would grant us knighthood for that one. But also stopping the rising war between the Sword Coast and my home land, as we are working on now.~ [c#ablank]
@230  = ~And I thought it would be a normal adventurers life giving me opportunity to grow with my profession. I never expected us to become heroes in the real sense.~
@231  = ~Of course, there's that *tiny* little problem with us still being wanted and accused of murder, but I am sure we will fix this soon, too.~
@232  = ~Sarevok - we confronted him! Well, kind of. Sarevok, who appearently is the murderer of your foster father, Gorion! How do you feel?~ [c#ablank]
@233  = ~Ready to chase him down and end this for good.~
@234  = ~I am glad we could safe the Dukes. I'll go after him, but more because I want to end the threat to the Sword Coast, not out of my personal revenge.~
@235  = ~How would I feel? He teleported away, the coward.~
@236  = ~I don't want to talk about this.~
@237  = ~The situation has turned - now he is the hunted one. Let's go and stop him for good.~
@238  = ~That's fine by me.~
@239  = ~Ah, the problems of a servant. I left the master's fine boots outside over night, and now they are gone. This has to be a prank of the town's youth, or who would steal worn boots? A fine pair, though. (sigh) If I don't find them soon, I'll have to confess to Master Travenhurst that they are lost.~
@240  = ~Ah, it's a nuisance, these youngsters! Nothing but full of mischief, and I have to stand up to my master for it.~
@241  = ~Oh, but what do I see? The master's boots! You found them! But... bite marks?! Foxes! The foxes took 'em? Luckily I can wipe those off. Some fat and effort and them boots'll shine as new. Hmph. Means I did them youngsters wrong - this time. Thank you, good <PRO_SIRMAAM>. I appreciate your effort to bring them here. Take this as a small reward from a servant. Now, off I'll go, wiping boots!~
@242  = ~The ogre is dead, I take it!~ [c#ablank]
@243  = ~So, nothing is hindering us from going into that cave. Possessions, here I come. Heh, er, yes. <CHARNAME>, we should be careful as to what awaits us in there. Xvarts, goblins? Or maybe a bear? Wolves?!~
@244  = ~You killed it without me, I see. Well, that was easier than I thought! Heh. Er, yes. Let's go inside the cave and look around for my possessions. I so hope they are still inside!~
@245  = ~I am thankfull you are doing this with me, <CHARNAME>.~
@246  = ~Oh no- nononononono. No.~ [c#ablank]
@247  = ~Gods, no!~
@248  = ~What is the matter?~
@249  = ~Stop fussing. Take your stuff and let's go.~
@250  = ~<CHARNAME>, do you see this? Do you see this pathetic pile of paper? Yes, this, this ... (Brandock flips a bundle of pages in his hands.) ... this pile of torn, gnawed-upon paper ...~
@251  = ~What kind of animal *does* that? But I already know it. There is no way of missing that smell. Foxes! Those little bastards you never get to see, because they are so shy. Came to my campsite and stole the book that was meant to be my entrance fee to Candlekeep to gnaw it into shreds. This - is - not - true!~
@252  = ~Please tell me it is not true.~
@253  = ~I'm afraid it seems to be so.~
@254  = ~Candlekeep? This book was worth *10,000* gold?!~
@255  = ~Foxes... It was good to go into this cave well prepared, indeed. Imagine what they could have done to us!~
@256  = ~Foxes would do something like that?~
@257  = ~I appreciate you having your fun. It's actually a good joke. Ha! But...~
@258  = ~Yes. And so much more... so much more, the wisdom in it alone!~
@259  = ~Goooooods...~
@260  = ~I am very sorry, Brandock.~
@261  = ~Those little fox teeth destroyed my most precious possession and with it my future life plan, which is more than any of the monsters I so far had to face managed to do.~
@262  = ~This... book should have been my entry into Candlekeep. I wanted to go to Candlekeep and study. This is what I wanted to do. At least some pages are still readable...~
@263  = ~Oh, and there's also a nice pair of boots with little fox bites. Could be returned to their owners, I reckon. Do you think they would notice if I gnaw on them a bit myself, first?~
@264  = ~Please, give me a minute. I need to regain my composure.~
@265  = ~(moans) That didn't work as planned. The plan was to regain the book and travel with you until my debt was cleared. Then go to Candlekeep and take my first steps towards becoming a world renowned wizard. The reality is - the book's disintegrated into colored paper snippets and Candlekeep is probably closed forever. And I'm devastated!~ [c#ablank]
@266  = ~Maybe the gate keeper will still accept it if I say it's a do-yourself-10,000-gold-book, you know, one of these real life object puzzles? (groans)~
@267  = ~I am really sorry, Brandock.~
@268  = ~You wanted to study in Candlekeep?~
@269  = ~You had an entry book to Candlekeep but now it's destroyed? This is tragic for me, too! I could have gone home with you!~
@270  = ~Bad things happen.~
@271  = ~Yes, I want to become a great and world renowned wizard, and so far my plan was to make the first step by studying magic in Candlekeep.~
@272  = ~This is tragic for me, too. I grew up in Candlekeep, but now that Gorion is gone, I cannot return, because they don't let *anyone* in without a valuable book. To think that you had such a book in your possession...~
@273  = ~What will you do now?~
@274  = ~Oh, I see! But, would we have met in time? Maybe I would have already entered Candlekeep by the time Gorion... I apologize for rising the topic. I mean, maybe we would have met on the street, but would not have combined forces. Probably just said "hello" when passing by. And then *you* would have had need of re-entering, and I would have learned, that Gorion... I mean...~
@275  = ~...And it is of absolutely no use to imagine all this, because it didn't happen...~
@276  = ~Thank you.~
@277  = ~Ha! Yes, I guess so. You have a ... refreshingly unemotional view on things.~
@278  = ~Bad things do happen, but I usually prefer them happening far away from me. Note to the gods: This does *not* include foxes tearing apart my most precious possession in a far away cave while I am sleeping!~
@279  = ~This is a serious question, <CHARNAME> - what am I supposed to do now?~
@280  = ~Let me give you your reward, before I drown in my self-pity. I won't start arguing about whether we actually recovered my book, because it was clear it was about you helping me to get to it... which we did... so here it is.~
@281  = ~I... I have nowhere to go now... I will stay with you then, longer than anticipated. I can stay with you, yes? Just for a while, until I... I re-arranged my plans for what to do...~
@282  = ~What else would you say leaves such a messy and *smelly* cave? Oh, they like to steal things. There was this pair of boots there, as well. And they are with puppies currently, in this time of year... The puppies probably need things to... train... their... teeth... (moans)~
@283  = ~G... Gorion? Wait - <CHARNAME>... from Candlekeep?! How can I be so *daft*? Of course you are <CHARNAME>, Gorion's foster child. What do you... what do you mean, "gone"? Are you saying...?~
@284  = ~...And I just lost a magic book of unspeakable worth. No, I did not "lose" it. I *destroyed* it! (Brandock groans and wipes his face with his palm.)~
@285  = ~I am sorry this happened. No one is safe for bad things to happen, as it seems.~
@286  = ~He's dead? He is really dead? Gods, <CHARNAME>, and here I am, mourning my own clumsiness, while you lost your father, your home... I am sorry for your loss!~
@287  = ~<CHARNAME>, do you believe in so much bad luck... or is it me? There is this 10,000 gold book, gnawed to shreads by foxes after they stole it from my camp-site - while I was happily snoring with it on my lap.~ [c#ablank]
@288  = ~And then there is that... incident including a half-ogre, after I cast magic on someone I didn't know anything about, ruining my reputation as a mage around these lands for time to come.~
@289  = ~Is this just bad luck or is it my clumsiness?~
@290  = ~Both, I think. You are good-hearted, but also a bit too trustful.~
@291  = ~It's bad luck, Brandock. It all could have gone completely different.~
@292  = ~It's you. Your judging of situations and actions to be taken is not the best.~
@293  = ~It's just you, and I would add stupidity and naivete to the list.~
@294  = ~Ouch. But, yes, that is how I feel right now. (sigh)~
@295  = ~Ever heard about leading by motivation?...~
@296  = ~Yes, I guess you are right.~
@297  = ~That is very nice of you to say, but is a rabbit not guilty of his own death, if it can't avoid the trap?~
@298  = ~Gods, I could huddle in that fox cave and hide for while, I can tell you that.~
@299  = ~So, <CHARNAME>, would you be ready to share a bit of information about yourself? I know your name, and I see your profession.~ [c#ablank]
@300  = ~I understood that you and Imoen were acquainted before you went adventuring.~
@301  = ~Yep! You bet.~
@302  = ~So, what brought you to travelling the Sword Coast?~
@303  = ~I grew up in Candlekeep. I was Gorion's foster child, but we had to leave in a hurry... Gorion was killed, and now I can't return.~
@304  = ~Actually I wanted to go adventuring all my life. Still, I didn't start with it out of my own plans.~
@305  = ~It all came like a shock, I'm still not quite adjusted to the new situation. All of a sudden, Gorion is gone and I'm outside my home of Candlekeep.~
@306  = ~I wouldn't know why this is of interest to you.~
@307  = ~<CHARNAME>, I am very sorry about your loss. To lose your father, and with him your home at the same time... Do you want to talk about it?~ [c#ablank]
@308  = ~It all happened so fast, Brandock. One moment, I am all cosy and protected inside the great Candlekeep library, running between the monk's legs. Next, it's assassins and ambushs and my foster father dying.~
@309  = ~No.~
@310  = ~Of course.~
@311  = ~That sounds awful.~
@312  = ~It is. (sigh)~
@313  = ~I'll be alright, I guess.~
@314  = ~And I cannot return inside Candlekeep. My home! They won't let me in because I don't have a valuable book.~
@315  = ~I don't want to talk more about it.~
@316  = ~Yes, the known entry fee to Candlekeep. This is very bad.~
@317  = ~You know, Gorion dead leaves a great hole in this world. He was the greatest and wisest. There are many who will miss him. Me, for example. I ... didn't know him. But I ... would have liked to have known him. To learn from him...~
@318  = ~I know this isn't a comfort for you. But perhaps the thought that others will miss him, too.~
@319  = ~Some people say time heals all woulds, but I think all that happens is a thick layer of moss growing over the things one would like to forget. If you are lucky, it's soft and keeps you warm. If you are unlucky, it starts dripping and there are small things living in it.~
@320  = ~<CHARNAME>, seriously - would you just give me a firm hit on my head when I start talking like that?~
@321  = ~I wanted to say I am sorry for your loss. I hope I did it without sounding disrespectful. I also do understand that you are in a very unsettling general situation currently, and I am happy about being of help.~
@322  = ~Well, we are travelling together, so...~
@323  = ~We don't need to know anything about each other. Just be a good mage, Brandock, that's all I need.~
@324  = ~G... Gorion? Wait, <CHARNAME>... from Candlkeep! I am so *daft*, of course! You would be Gorion's foster child... but... he is dead?!~
@325  = ~Yes, my foster father is dead.~
@326  = ~That is what happened.~
@327  = ~We all have to die eventually.~
@328  = ~No? How did it came to it, then? If you don't mind my curiosity.~
@329  = ~Actually, I do mind. It's none of your business.~
@330  = ~Pffffuh, alright, I guess that should work, too.~
@331  = ~Yes, that we do, but...~
@332  = ~Gods, <CHARNAME>, and here I am, trying to draw you into a casual chat, while you lost your father, your home...~
@333  = ~Is it.. is it really true?~
@334  = ~Nashkel (sigh). Didn't think I would be so soon back to..., er, back to here, I mean in Amnish lands. But Nashkel is different to main Amn, believe me. Oh yes, it is.~ [c#ablank]
@335  = ~You know this why?~
@336  = ~You've been here before?~
@337  = ~You know about Amn and how it treats its mages?~
@338  = ~Yes, I know that magic is despised and controlled in Amn.~
@339  = ~Haha, you grew up in Candlekeep? Er... you... you grew up IN CANDLEKEEP?! Wait, <CHARNAME>... from Candlkeep! I am so *daft*, of course! You would be Gorion's foster child!~
@340  = ~Ah yes, so you heard.~
@341  = ~G... Gorion? He is dead?!~
@342  = ~Are you deaf?~
@343  = ~Em - because it's Candlekeep, THE greatest librabry? Dream of... of, well, many mages in these lands?...~
@344  = ~I don't know much about you, besides your name. I was interested in Gorion, mainly. I don't know him personally, of course, but who wouldn't know Gorion, the wise sage and powerful wizard, residing in Candlekeep?~
@345  = ~What made you leave the library?~
@346  = ~Why shouldn't I leave it?~
@347  = ~Gods, <CHARNAME>, and here I am, babbling about where I'm from, while you lost your father, your home... I am sorry for your loss!~
@348  = ~It's alright. How do you know so much about Amn?~
@349  = ~It's getting late. Let's move on.~
@350  = ~Well, the lands north from the Cloud Peaks are a bit... less fanatic about this. The people's mentality is different for one, but also the presence of Cowled Wizards is far less common.~
@351  = ~Of course, I forgot for a moment where you grew up.~
@352  = ~Erm, well, I mean... I, er... Gods, I was hoping not to have to tell this, but there is no use in hiding, either. (takes a deep breath)~
@353  = ~Well, Nashkel is still Amnish soil so... let's just be careful and not raise any suspicion, just to be sure.~
@354  = ~Sure. I will be quiet.~
@355  = ~<CHARNAME>, I tried to avoid the subject, but we are travelling together longer than I imagined at first.~ [c#ablank]
@356  = ~I, well. I am from Amn. But I am not a spy! I swear. Which is exactly the thing a spy would do? But no, I think a spy would have such a fail-proof alibi and back-story you would never even have the faintest idea he would be from Amn. *Or* a spy would make up a story as pathetic as mine to try and be convincing.~
@357  = ~Er, is it believable?~
@358  = ~You tried to avoid the subject? What do you mean?~
@359  = ~Is what believable? Are you a spy or not?~
@360  = ~You had to come all this way for what you want to achieve?~
@361  = ~From Amn?! What are you doing here at the Sword Coast at a time like this?~
@362  = ~I couldn't care less where you are from. Cross me and you will regret it.~
@363  = ~What? NO! I said I am not.~
@364  = ~Making a fool out of myself, mostly...~
@365  = ~Oh, yes. We can have a long, extended talk about what Amn thinks of mages in general later, <CHARNAME>.~
@366  = ~It's called bad timing. I set out to become a great, wise mage. I cannot do that in Amn, not with a soul that is able to feel empathy. Er, I did *not* imply that great, powerful mages in Amn tend to have sold their souls to some demon plains and are evil as hell. No, nono. Surely not.~
@367  = ~But it is known that magic in Amn is, well, a tricky subject, that is why I came here. To learn, to train. And landed right in the middle of the iron crisis and the rising tension. Now, I am trying to make the best out of it.~
@368  = ~I have no *intention* of crossing you, or anyone else. That's what I said. Or trying to say.~
@369  = ~Me, being from Amn! Rising tension between the lands? Upcoming war betwen Amn and Baldur's Gate? I don't want to give anyone the wrong impression why I am here.~
@370  = ~Er. Alright, now the news is spilled, I'll go back into line.~
@371  = ~Soooo... Seems we are rather good at being travel companions, what do you think?~ [c#ablank]
@372  = ~I'd even say we could become friends.~
@373  = ~I think so, yes.~
@374  = ~Are you nervous about something?~
@375  = ~This really makes you nervous, doesn't it?~
@376  = ~Is this supposed to be casual chitchat?~
@377  = ~If I ignore your rather pathetic magic performance, yes.~
@378  = ~F... Friends? Really? That - that is great! That you think that way, I mean.~
@379  = ~I think so, too!~
@380  = ~What, me? Nervous? Haha, why would *I* be... dang, you are right.~
@381  = ~What? No, er... yes, probably.~
@382  = ~Ouch.~
@383  = ~I... I am nervous about being a mage from Amn. I mean, *I* am not nervous to be one, but I am nervous about what you might think of it. Do you... do you have any more questions regarding my motives of being here?~
@384  = ~Why would I?~
@385  = ~Actually, yes.~
@386  = ~No, it's alright, Brandock. Relax.~
@387  = ~I'm already travelling with others from Amn, so there is really no need.~
@388  = ~No, because I know you are a spy.~
@389  = ~I couldn't care less about your motives, Brandock. Be a better mage in the future, and we will come along well.~
@390  = ~Ack! You just said that! You don't believe that, do you?~
@391  = ~You can ask me anything, anytime. Please - I really did not chose the rising tension between the lands to happen now when I finally found the courage to come here, and I definitely do not want it to lead to any misunderstandings between me and my travel companions.~
@392  = ~So - if you have any questions, just shoot. With your questions, I mean, not an arrow or a bolt... I'm not babbling, am I? I'm babbling.~
@393  = ~Er, sure...~
@394  = ~What? Why would you *not*? I mean...~
@395  = ~I'll be quiet now.~
@396  = ~They ... they really didn't let you back into Candlekeep?~ [c#ablank]
@397  = ~That is what happened, yes.~
@398  = ~Isn't it horrible? I was standing there, and the Gatekeeper who knew me since I was a toddler looked into my face and said 'nope, not without a valuable book, you won't'.~
@399  = ~I think so, but to be honest, I didn't even try.~
@400  = ~Really? May I ask why not?~
@401  = ~Gorion told me to go to the Friendly Arm Inn to meet friends there. It felt the natural thing to do what he said.~
@402  = ~Candlekeep didn't feel safe any more. Gorion's rushed departure, the assassins, the ambush - I had the impression I should move on, not back.~
@403  = ~Gorion is dead, and I wanted to go adventuring.~
@404  = ~But why do you think they'd do that? It's ... cruel. Are they thoughtless or evil? Or maybe ... scared?~
@405  = ~I come from a place where books are more important than people, Brandock. I am not surprised they shut me out - not necessarily to protect themselves, but to protect the keep and the wisdom within it from the harm they think my presence will bring.~
@406  = ~It's a good question, actually. Maybe they relied on Gorion's opinion, but he's dead, so he can no longer protect me.~
@407  = ~Maybe they do not see me to belong to Candlekeep, but to Gorion. So, from their perspective, Candlekeep is not my home.~
@408  = ~I was merely tolerated, Brandock. A nuisance they beared because Gorion said so. Now that he's dead, maybe they secretly accuse me of his death. I think they are quite happy I am no longer there. I seem to draw too much attention.~
@409  = ~Hm. I never thought of it that way. I always thought they are just so far away from reality they don't even notice how cruel it is.~
@410  = ~They didn't let me in because I didn't carry a valuable book.~
@411  = ~Erm, yes. Sure. That was the obvious reason. I see you don't want to talk about this further, so ... let's get on with things, yes?~
@412  = ~I understand.~
@413  = ~I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. Although you seem to cope quite well, I am sorry how you lost your home.~
@414  = ~They ... they really didn't let you back into Candlekeep with a valuable book!~
@415  = ~<CHARNAME>, I keep on thinking that you grew up where I yearned to be so desparately... I am talking about Candlekeep. Do you mind if we talk about it?~ [c#ablank]
@416  = ~No, as I already said, you can ask me anything you want.~
@417  = ~It's alright, just ask.~
@418  = ~I'd rather not talk about it.~
@419  = ~Thank you!~
@420  = ~I mean... to be honest I am not as thrilled to talk about it as I was before we found the remains of the book, but still - I haven't given up hope completely that one day, I might be able to get inside nontheless. If I'll still dare to show my face there, that is.~
@421  = ~I have to admit that your story dampened my spirits about that place. That they'd apply the stupid book rule to you!~
@422  = ~That's not what I thought you'd ask about the place.~
@423  = ~Don't get me started about Ulraunt. He really doesn't like me.~
@424  = ~They were happy I was gone, I'd figure.~
@425  = ~I know.~
@426  = ~Oh dear. That doesn't sound good.~
@427  = ~I wanted to ask about the books - about the monks - about the wise mages residing there - if it is true that *everyone* has to get up at five in the morning, but somehow all I can think of is that apparently, the saying "not everything is gold that glitters" is also true for the greatest library in the lands. (sigh)~
@428  = ~There's still a lot of really great people around. I mean amiable ones.~
@429  = ~That is true, I guess.~
@430  = ~I am glad to hear it.~
@431  = ~I mean, it's not a stupid rule per se - it's probably the reason it *is* the greatest library - but it is if applied to someone grown up there. They can't make me believe they charge their hunters and the merchants delivering the foods with a 10,000 book every time they return?!~
@432  = ~Well, *those* probably didn't grew up there, so...~
@433  = ~Not if they don't want to starve, that is.~
@434  = ~No, definitely not!~
@435  = ~Then I'll leave you in peace.~
@436  = ~Ha! They'd change the rule to "something to eat to enter" rather quickly, I'd think!~
@437  = ~I like your sense of humor. And I envy you for being able to jest about this. Thank you!~
@438  = ~I hope you will be able to return one day, <CHARNAME>... Not only to "Candlekeep", but to your *home*.~
@439  = ~All the things we are achieving... but still no real clue as to who is chasing you. How are you, <CHARNAME>?~ [c#ablank]
@440  = ~I am not sure. It's all so overwhelming.~
@441  = ~I feel alright. I like adventuring, as it seems.~
@442  = ~Devastated. I wish I could return home and just be safe.~
@443  = ~Eager and determined to get to the one who did this to me!~
@444  = ~It surely must be!~
@445  = ~That's definitely a good thing!~
@446  = ~Oh, yes. I understand the sentinent.~
@447  = ~I keep on thinking... Maybe it is all connected? You know, someone chasing you, and Ulraunt closing Candlekeep to you. Maybe they suspect your presence to be a threat to the monastery.~
@448  = ~That would mean they know things I don't, because I have no clue.~
@449  = ~Duh, you figured that out by yourself? I think it is rather obvious.~
@450  = ~That makes a lot of sense. It wasn't a secret that there is a threat... I still can't get my head around the fact that it is addressing *me*.~
@451  = ~Let's not talk about this, Brandock.~
@452  = ~That's a frightening thought, indeed.~
@453  = ~Oh.~
@454  = ~But what if... What if you being Gorion's foster child was the reason for someone coming after you? I know there were assassins after the ambush, but maybe they worked with obsolete bounty notes, because they didn't know Gorion was already dead!~
@455  = ~I don't know, it sounded better a moment ago, when I turned the thought in my head.~
@456  = ~It's a thought, though. Still, I am going after the ones who killed Gorion, and then we'll see what they want from me!~
/* the following refers to Strref #2920 in BG:EE */
@457  = ~I don't know... "hand over your ward" sounded pretty specific to me, and not like it was meant just because I am connected to Gorion.~
@458  = ~But if it were about Gorion, he wouldn't have taken me with him! They killed Gorion because he protected me!~
@459  = ~I'd prefer we wouldn't speculate about this.~
@460  = ~Hm.~
@461  = ~Whatever it will turn out to be, I will not shy away from this, <CHARNAME>. I am not the bravest, but I told you I'd stand with you, and I will keep my word!~
@462  = ~I was temped once by magic whose power I would not have been able to control.~

/* brandock_Bhaalreaction.d */
@650  = ~Bhaal would be your father, you would be sired by a god? Which is now dead, I might add. You didn't know this, I take it?~ [c#ablank]
@651  = ~No, I didn't.~
@652  = ~Does it look like I did?~
@653  = ~This is none of your business.~
@654  = ~Whether you knew it is none of my business, indeed. But knowing who I'm travelling with is of high interest to me, and not only because of selfish reasons.~
@655  = ~No, you definitely did not.~
@656  = ~I'm guessing this is not what you expected to hear about your real parents?~
@657  = ~I couldn't help but overhear the chanters outside, singing about Alaundo's Prophecies about the children of Bhaal spreading chaos and destruction in their search of their father's power.~
@658  = ~I see why this knowledge may stir fear in people and increase their interest in you. Bhaal may be dead, but some power is tinkering with you in your dreams and granting you these abilities. We came to Candlekeep to investigate and I think we just found a big piece of the puzzle about what is happening to you. I'm just not sure how to read it all yet.~
@659  = ~So, you are a child of Bhaal, Gorion knew, he died defending you against one of your power-hungry "brothers", which you defeated - and I should probably not talk like this if all I wanted to ask was: how are you, <CHARNAME>?~ [c#ablank]
@660  = ~As well as can be expected.~
@661  = ~Still trying to understand what happened.~
@662  = ~Not well, Brandock. I wish I could turn back time.~
@663  = ~None of your business.~
@664  = ~"As well as can be expected" means not well, at least where I come from.~
@665  = ~No, really, I am doing fine.~
@666  = ~And with me, it means what it says: I am well, as well as can be expected after being kicked out of my home, having witnessed my father being murdered, being chased through the lands, and having confronted a foe who set half the land in motion to gain power and killing me in the process - who, on top of it all, is my "brother" in godly heritage which I didn't know anything about until he more or less told me to my face.~
@667  = ~You are right. I am still struggling with all what happened.~
@668  = ~I am regretting having asked the way I did - I am sorry, <CHARNAME>, I *meant* to comfort you.~
@669  = ~(smile) You did, Brandock. Thank you for asking.~
@670  = ~It's alright. It's difficult to comfort someone who experienced all this, I guess.~
@671  = ~Let's stop the talk here.~
@672  = ~Thank you!~
@673  = ~I understand - we all do, I think. It was much to take in.~
@674  = ~I am fine, Brandock. I'm not in shock or anything, just not finished wrapping my head around all the things that happened.~
@675  = ~Much indeed - being kicked out of my home, having witnessed my father being murdered, being chased through the lands, and having confronted a foe who set half the land in motion to gain power and killing me in the process - who, on top of it all, is my "brother" in godly heritage which I didn't know anything about until he told me to my face.~
@676  = ~I am glad to hear it. I am not sure I would be.~
@677  = ~When my magic talent was discovered, I thought it to be a life changing, destiny shaping, everything else-overshadowing revelation... I hope this doesn't sound like I would compare the revelation of my magic talent with your heritage to the god of murder. I absolutely don't.~
@678  = ~That was the essence of my babbling: That it is not comparable, because what you are experiencing is really life changing, destiny shaping, and everything-else-overshadowing. Although I would like to point out that being a mage in Amn is sometimes a synonym for having a contageous, lethal desease, or at least, being very, very much near living as an outcast, if you get the chance to live long at all. But it doesn't change your status as a mortal... *This* is really big. You have my sympathy, <CHARNAME>!~
@679  = ~Understood. Still, you have my sympathy, <CHARNAME>. Getting to know that you are not the normal mortal you thought you were is really big.~
@680  = ~<CHARNAME>, you asked me recently whether I am scared of you because of your Bhaal heritage. I said I am not, and I meant it.~ [c#ablank]
@681  = ~<CHARNAME>, just in case this is not clear, I am not scared of you because of your Bhaal heritage.~ [c#ablank]
@682  = ~What *does* scare me, though, is what happens to you *because* of your heritage. All those people chasing you ... killing your foster father ... If that comes with being a child of Bhaal, then it scares me very much.~
@683  = ~It scares me too, to be honest.~
@684  = ~Don't forget the powers gained by dreaming, and an unusual interest by a strange old man in a wizard hat named Elminster...~
@685  = ~There are a lot of people experiencing similar things without such a "good" explanation... I guess.~
@686  = ~Considering there is almost nothing that does not scare you I don't see anything special.~
@687  = ~I can imagine.~
@688  = ~I can't change it, I'm afraid.~
@689  = ~That's... that's exactly what I wanted to say next!~
@690  = ~... I didn't list all those, yes.~
@691  = ~Ouch.~
@692  = ~I really don't know whether it makes any sense, but I am ... relieved there is such an explanation for the things happening to you. Knowing it's your Bhaal heritage that is drawing all this hostile attention. It does make sense, you know? It is ... less scary, if looked at it like that. At least for me.~

/* brandock_bookrestore.d */
@750  = ~Hello, young adventurers.~
@751  = ~Ah, the young <CHARNAME> and <PRO_HISHER> unfortunate friend. I see you have everything I requested here. Let us begin with preserving the remaining book snippets against further destruction, shall we?~
@752  = ~Master Elvenhair, we came here with a request of, erm, well I would say it is important but that is dependent of perspective, of course, and... ah, blast it! (Brandock takes out the remains of his book, mumbling something about "extremely sorry" and "foxes".)~ [c#ablank]
@753  = ~Oh, this is very unfortunate. The poor book! Foxes, you say? (murmurs) I think I should talk to Tethtoril about extending the protection spells... (clears his throat) So you want to work on restoring this, I figure?~
@754  = ~Er, yes, it was my hope you would help me with it... or let me help you with it, to be more precise... Master Elvenhair, I cannot say how grateful I am that you call this whole incident "unfortunate" and nothing else! Would I be you, I'd call it by much more drastic words, I can tell you that. I... I do not come to you with such a request without any proof of my abilities, Master Elvenhair. See this seal - it would have granted me access to Candlekeep as a seeker, had I the book still with me.~
@755  = ~A seal from Purgan from Riatavin, signed with the signet of Alisarhold! Young friend, if Purgan from Alisarhold thought you ready and worthy to find entrance to Candlekeep, then this is enough for me to help you with your studies. Do not thank me too soon, young friend. I have some requirements for you to fulfill before we start working on the book snippets. I want you to collect the following items: a potion of restoration, ink of an octopus - you usually can buy this from fishermen as they know mages need it occasionally, but it is expensive. Milking an octopus will do just as well, and if you ever went through the hassle of retrieving ink from an octopus yourself you will value the ink more I can tell you - and a Star Sapphire.~
@756  = ~Once you retrieved all the ingredients we will first stabilize the book pages. After that, we will work on restoring the book. My time is scarce and I have many obligations, but I understood you are travelling with young <CHARNAME> now, so when we will find time to work on this now and again it will suffice, hm? This is nothing one can accomplish in a tenday. This will keep you busy for the next years, my young friend, and you will go on working on it after I'll show you everything you need to know to work on it.~
@757  = ~Thank you... thank you, Master Elvenhair.~
@758  = ~What... what just happened? Why is this a book now? Where does this book come from?~ [c#ablank]
@759  = ~Oh, I didn't expect this to happen. Hm... Seems the creator of this book included a saftey restoration - the destroyed book used our restoration attempts and transformed back into a book. But, since it was heavily damaged, it keeps its spells secret for now. At least I *think* this is what the first pages are saying, but my Ruathlek is not the best. To understand the rest I'd need my translation tables, which are in Candlekeep.~
@760  = ~You've... *got* to be kidding me.~
@761  = ~This is most fascinating, it seems this transformation magic is part of the simplified magic recipes characterizing the De Simplex Magicae. We just lifted the book to its next level of existence, and a lot could be learnt from that. You need to find a way into Candlekeep with this, young friend. Unfortunately, it is not valuable enough in its current state, but it will be a most precious object of study. If you'll ever earn the way into Candlekeep, I will make sure the sages know about this.~
@762  = ~This was most interesting an experience in my old days, young man. I do have the feeling that you do not have to write down the book's spells by heart as we thought you would. They are all still inside the book, only magically hidden.~
@763  = ~Thank you, Master Elvenhair. I don't know what to say... <CHARNAME>, I... I need to process what just happened. My head feels like it's gonna *explode*.~
@764  = ~We have all requested ingredients! Please, <CHARNAME>, let us return to Master Elvenhair!~ [c#ablank]
@765  = ~He's helping me... he's helping me he's helping me he's HELPING ME! <CHARNAME>! Elvenahir will help me restore the De Simplex Magicae!!~ [c#ablank]
@766  = ~That's awesome!~
@767  = ~I did notice, Brandock, I was standing like four feet away when it came to pass.~
@768  = ~Don't forget to breath, Brandock!~
@769  = ~It is! It is it is it is it IS!~
@770  = ~I'm sorry I'm so excited. But I'm *so* excited! I... arrrrrrgh, I will be calm now.~
@771  = ~Let's go find the things he requested! I promise, I'll help retrieve the gold we need to acquire them.~
@772  = ~And we already have some of the required ingredients! Let's go find the other things he requested! I promise, I'll help retrieve the gold we need to acquire them.~
@773  = ~And we already have everything he requested! Er, why did we leave? Let's go back inside! Please!~
@774  = ~Well, that-that definitely went differently than expected.~ [c#ablank]
@775  = ~It definitely did, yes.~
@776  = ~Your book is a book again!~
@777  = ~You "lifted the book to its next level of existance", eh?~
@778  = ~Don't tell me we will go through *another* "I can't believe what happened" phase!~
@779  = ~Great, now we can go back to do important things.~
@780  = ~But I definitely am in such a phase! Or did you understand what happened?~
@781  = ~It-it turned into a whole book - I mean a book in whole - I mean a real book, with cover and pages, not "whole" in the sense of "everything is inside". By itself! From those snippets and pieces I recovered from the fox hole. Because of a restoration spell!~
@782  = ~You really think the creators of that book put such a spell on it on purpose?~
@783  = ~I know, Brandock, I was there when it happened.~
@784  = ~I'm sorry, I'm still trying to process what happened.~
@785  = ~What else could it be? Yes, I believe they did. But of course we will only know for sure once I have the chance to study it accordingy. Which Master Elvenhair proposed I should do in Candlekeep!~
@786  = ~Master Elvenhair would welcome me in Candlekeep with this book to study. Candlekeep! He said that, didn't he? You heard it too?~
@787  = ~Yes, he definitely was most fascinated by the whole thing.~
@788  = ~I am very happy for you, Brandock.~
@789  = ~Now all that you still need is another most valuable book to enter, I guess.~
@790  = ~He made it sound as if I'd even be *welcome* there, with this book. "Next level of existance", and all it needed was a little teeth-work and a restauration spell.~
@791  = ~I can't believe how fate turned. It-it *did* turn, didn't it? Something good came out of this, this *mess*. I feel blessed and cursed at the same time, <CHARNAME>. Cursed, because I will remain the laughing stock of every mage out there, but blessed because it gave me the opportunity to not only restore the original magic spells the book contained, but also to discover unknown protection spells the creators put onto it.~
@792  = ~But, oh no, I will not start to think I *achieved* anything with what happened. It will be a fine specimen for examination, and maybe no one would have found out if it wouldn't have happened, but... No, I will never pretend it was a great achievement to have it destroyed first.~
@793  = ~I understand what you mean.~
@794  = ~Still, it's true. Protected in the high halls of some monastery, no one would have discovered that secret.~
@795  = ~That we can! That we definitely can.~
@796  = ~But... the thought of not being expelled from Candlekeep - that I might be welcome, even! I have a goal again, <CHARNAME>. I will help you with your endeavors, and with my share of gold I will buy a new book, valuable enough to get entry into the monastery. Some day, <CHARNAME>. Some day I will be there!~
@797  = ~I know it's true, but... I will never be anything compared to being proud about it, you know.~
@798  = ~<CHARNAME>, I was so stumped when the book restored itself to what it is now. I completely forgot to thank you for taking me to Master Elvenhair!~ [c#ablank]
@799  = ~It was my pleasure.~
@800  = ~It was a quite surprising event, indeed.~
@801  = ~He is really the friendliest mage in Candlekeep. Well, Tethtoril is friendly, too, but with much more authority in his manners.~
@802  = ~Took you long enough.~
@803  = ~I will be forever in your debt.~
@804  = ~Ha! That is true and an understatement at the same time.~
@805  = ~I envy you for growing up with mages like them...~
@806  = ~Don't get me wrong and think that would be the only thing I value about you, but - to have met you, from all people travelling on the road, with your connections to Candlekeep and Master Elvenhair! I can't believe how fate smiled upon me when we first talked at the Coast Way.~
@807  = ~I am really happy for you, Brandock.~
@808  = ~It does sound as if it'd be the only thing you'd value about me, I'm afraid.~
@809  = ~Let's get going.~
@810  = ~It did, didn't it...~
@811  = ~...Blasted, I'm really not good at this.~
@812  = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>, for caring and helping me... I can't imagine you don't regret taking me along already.~
@813  = ~I can't believe I destroyed such a precious magic book.~ [c#ablank]
@814  = ~You didn't destroy it. The foxes did.~
@815  = ~I am very sorry, Brandock.~
@816  = ~Yeah, me neither.~
@817  = ~There is quite a bit happening around you I can't believe is happening.~
@818  = ~Which book was it?~
@819  = ~Spare me any self-pity, please.~
@820  = ~Your comfort is... not existing. But I guess I deserve it.~
@821  = ~Me neither, <CHARNAME>...~
@822  = ~Thank you. I appreciate your attempt to comfort me.~
@823  = ~I'm not even sure what to say. I don't even know what to *think*.~
@824  = ~What, you mean you didn't recognize it when I picked it up? (scoffs unhappily)~
@825  = ~Do you know which book that was?~
@826  = ~Tell me.~
@827  = ~Should I?~
@828  = ~No, because first time I saw it it is wasn't really recognisable, was it?~
@829  = ~You know I don't.~
@830  = ~Brandock - enough. We can't change what happened. Focus on our tasks.~
@831  = ~It was the "De Simplex Magicae". It was a book about very complex spells, but explained in a way that it made it easy to cast them, even if of lower level. It was a *very valuable* book, and also of high historical value.~
@832  = ~Sounds like a powerful book, too.~
@833  = ~I could have had use for such a book. A pity you let it be destroyed.~
@834  = ~Where did it come from?~
@835  = ~(scoffs unhappily) No, it wasn't.~
@836  = ~Hells yes, that it was.~
@837  = ~Yes, I... I destroyed it...~
@838  = ~Bowgentle wrote it! Appearently, it's a predecessor to Bowgentle's Book which he created in the School of Wonder, only 10 years before the school was destroyed. The "De Simplex Magicae" is probably a preliminary study by Bowgentle and some of his students, before he simplified some of the spells even more.~
@839  = ~All that knowledge! To have destroyed such knowledge... I don't think I can forgive me this.  - I'll be the one going down in history as the destroyer of it... I destroyed... I destroyed "De Simplex Magicae"...~
@840  = ~No, you didn't, Brandock. The foxes did.~
@841  = ~We've been through this, Brandock. It wasn't you who did it.~
@842  = ~Yes, you did, but we can't change it now.~
@843  = ~Man up, Brandock! Mistakes happen.~
@844  = ~I... I really appreciate your attempts to comfort me.~
@845  = ~I think I'm still in shock. I'll shut up now, or I'll say the same things over, and over.~
@846  = ~I am dead. Not literally, of course, but as a mage. My plan to go to Candlekeep... I am dead.~ [c#ablank]
@847  = ~You mean if this new travels around, you'll lose reputation as a mage?~
@848  = ~What do you mean?~
@849  = ~There are other valuable books out there, Brandock.~
@850  = ~I'm sure it will work out somehow. Let's move on.~
@851  = ~You think I wouldn't?~
@852  = ~Of course, but that's not what I meant.~
@853  = ~Anyone destroying written knowledge will be excluded and banned from Candlekeep forever, that's their dogma. I destroyed Bowgentle's "De Simplex Magicae"... I wanted to study in Cadelkeep, and now they will ban me... they have to, don't they?~
@854  = ~We already talked about this, and you know I think you don't know unless you try.~
@855  = ~Not necessarily. That dogma is for people that destroy written knowledge out of malice, which you didn't do.~
@856  = ~I know that rule, Brandock. You didn't destroy it.~
@857  = ~Hm, I forgot about that... that sounds bad indeed.~
@858  = ~What if they don't get to know?~
@859  = ~What if you make up for it somehow?~
@860  = ~What will you do?~
@861  = ~You are drowning in self-pity, Brandock.~
@862  = ~"The foxes did" yes, I know, but don't you agree it sounds like the weakest excuse ever?~
@863  = ~It does, doesn't it?~
@864  = ~As if I could hide such a knowledge!~
@865  = ~Why not? You had the book hidden so far.~
@866  = ~But how... how would I make up for a book like that. Best if *I* stay away from any precious book in the future... and donate my gold to those who are capable of writing such books. Every library, every monastery, every place of wise people need gold to be sustained, no? I could collect gold and give it away, to people wise enough to write books like the De Simplex Magicae. That's the only compensation I could think of... and it won't open the doors to Candlekeep for me.~
@867  = ~But not from everyone! There are people who know I have it.~
@868  = ~Right now, I just go from one moment to the next. I have absolutely no idea what I'll do. Maybe I could hide...~
@869  = ~No, I will not hide what I did. It happened, there is no way around it. I will not lie, and I will not hide myself... although I probably should...~
@870  = ~Yes, I drown in self-pity, I admit that, but is it really all you can see here? Don't you care about the destroyed book at all?~
@871  = ~I'm sorry. I see it means a lot to you.~
@872  = ~In the end, it was just a book, Brandock.~
@873  = ~No. I care about whether this incident occupies my group's mage, and if so, whether I should look for someone else to fill the spot.~
@874  = ~I can't imagine what people will say if they hear about this. The person who left me the book, if I ever meet him again. Other mages, who knew the book. There is no way of 'I possess it, so I can do with it what I want'. Oh no, not with a book like that.~
@875  = ~I hope it tasted nice. And maybe, just maybe the gods will hear my curses and Beregost Manor will have a new fox fur carpet, some time in the future. Yes. Aah, what a wonderful thought.~
@876  = ~Oh, I wished I could see it like that.~
@877  = ~I... I understand. I am quiet now.~
@878  = ~And I already shouted into your face why I think it's a really bad idea!~
@879  = ~I wanted the book to be safe. I took it all the way to Alisarhold because I knew it's not in good hands with me. I only learned there *how* valuable of a book that was, but still.~ [c#ablank]
@880  = ~Alisarhold?~
@881  = ~Ah, Alisarhold, the Amnian library in the Snowflake Mountains.~
@882  = ~You were in Alisarhold? Then why coming to Candlekeep?~
@883  = ~Still don't want to hear about your self-pity.~
@884  = ~(moans)~
@885  = ~Sorry, Alisarhold is the greatest Amnian library, it's located in the Snowflake Mountains, which are east to the Shilmista forest.~
@886  = ~Exactly that one.~
@887  = ~Because Alisarhold is Cowled Wizards' territory, and I wanted to leave it. And because I needed a book of such value to get entry to Candlekeep. Because they said it's my right to take it... I can tell you all about it later. After I'll wake up from this nightmare... This is a dream, right?~
@888  = ~We even put a tracking ward onto the book. And they gave me an enchanted book case. Protected so no one but me could take out the book, and so that it would stay with me as long as the book is inside, and... And I fell *asleep* with the book out of the book case... *And* the foxes got to it, and... (Brandock's voice trails away.)~ [c#ablank]
@889  = ~I am really sorry, Brandock. I wished I could help you in any way.~
@890  = ~There is always things one doesn't anticipate, and sometimes they are fatal.~
@891  = ~At least you accept now that it was the foxes who did the actual destruction. I'd say you are one step further in coping with this, Brandock.~
@892  = ~Cope with this in silence, I don't want to hear it.~
@893  = ~This is not even a good story. I mean seriously, if you'd hear this being told as a story, would you think it's a good, believable, catching one? I wouldn't. *Way* too much drama. And rediculous, outright pathetic, that's all that it is.~
@894  = ~I'm trying to!~
@895  = ~The only reason I had the book on my lab and not inside the case when falling asleep is because I read in it every free minute I could spare. That is how much I valued it... (moans)~ [c#ablank]
@896  = ~I can only imagine how much you're missing it now that it's gone.~
@897  = ~Loved to death, so to say.~
@898  = ~Your mistake was travelling alone.~
@899  = ~Brandock, cope in silence, please.~
@900  = ~That's actually quite funny, but I don't feel like laughing currently.~
@901  = ~Definitely, and I won't do that mistake again!~
@902  = ~I even tried to copy the book, but that was before I left for Alisarhold and before I had any experience in it, so my attempt to replicate its magic let my scroll burst into flames, and with it all my writing utensils, and half of my parents' table. It's *the* table of my parents. They only have one. But as I said, that was before I was taught the basics on how to do something like this...~
@903  = ~I *want* to do magic. I want to learn, I want to be able to control it, but foremost, I want to *learn* about it! And now... now I don't dare touch such a book again, of fear it might happen again!~
@904  = ~You are by far the most interested in magic and wisdom I met since leaving Candlekeep.~
@905  = ~This can't be your solution to this.~
@906  = ~Do you see such a book here? I don't, so what's the problem?~
@907  = ~Don't you think you are overreacting just a little tiny bit?~
@908  = ~But how... how am I to overcome this... this shock? Should I search for a teacher... a powerful wizard who will look over me. Or should I stay away from such precious books for the rest of my life?~
@909  = ~How about something in between? "For the rest of your life" is quite a long time.~
@910  = ~Brandock, is "having a powerful wizard as a teacher" any option currently? I don't think so.~
@911  = ~How about sleeping over it a couple of more nights, Brandock. You are still quite devastated, that was never a good moment to make decisions.~
@912  = ~I know I am overreacting, <CHARNAME>, it's how I am! I am still trying to process what happened and how to deal with it.~
@913  = ~But it won't stay that way in my life forever, or at least I surely hope so!~
@914  = ~What am I thinking about this, anyway! I will be banned from Candlekeep and rejected by any mage who has a name and cares to keep a good reputation. Let's move on, <CHARNAME>, your weak excuse for a mage is ready to be at your service.~
@915  = ~(Brandock takes a deep breath.) I'll learn to live with it, and some day, I'll also learn not to talk about my turmoil. This will still take a while, I'm afraid.~
@916  = ~I... I can't leave it at that. Fine, so I will be expelled and rejected by any mage or monastery who has an interest in keeping their good reputation... But I can't switch off that head of mine, <CHARNAME>. I can't stop my memories of spells and wise things I read and heard going round and round in it, and I can't stop the magic pouring out of my hands... well, alright, I *could* stop the latter, but I don't want to!~ [c#ablank]
@917  = ~And foremost... those stupid spells out of the "De Simplex Magicae"! They are in my head, telling me to write them down...~
@918  = ~Are you saying you know the spells by heart?~
@919  = ~Do I have to listen to this?~
@920  = ~As I said, I read that book every spare minute. I didn't only read it. I wanted to know that book inside out. I am not sure why, it felt as if it was my obligation... Funny, now that I think of it. As if I'd known I would lose it. Which I only did because I studied it like a berserker. If the gods think this is funny I tend to differ strongly.~
@921  = ~I have all the memories of the spells in my head. I always seemed to be able to remember some things with unusual accuracy, my official Cowled Wizard's teacher surely hated me for it.~
@922  = ~I have all the memories of the spells in my head. I *was* able to cast one of its spells out of my memory so Master Thalantyr recognized it instantly.~
@923  = ~Maybe... maybe my doom could turn into my blessing? Like, if I'd find a kind, wise mage who would help me rewrite the book, or at least parts of it, then having lost it while learning to write one myself wouldn't be so pointless? With some pages still readable and some to a certain extend, an experienced sage should be able to recreate most spells in that book when I tell him what I remember, no?~
@924  = ~Definitely. This sounds like a good plan.~

@926  = ~Finally, an occupation you can do in silence. Terrific! Go and do that. And leave me alone with it.~
@927  = ~No, I wouldn't know who would be ready to work with me on this. And I seriously doubt anyone would be willing to. Work on this with *me*, I mean.~
@928  = ~I will start right away. Not a magic scroll, don't worry. But I will note down the recipes I remember. So, when I'll find a wise mage who'll help me with this then I'll be prepared... In 50 years or so.~
@929  = ~No, you don't. But know that I am determined to write down all recipes from "De Simplex Magicae" I can still remember.~
@930  = ~(Something made you stirr at night. You see Brandock - fallen asleep with his book on his lap.)~ [c#ablank]
@931  = ~Shh, Brandock! Wake up!~
@932  = ~Er, Brandock? Waiting for some foxes again?~
@933  = ~(You gently remove the book from his lap and stow it away.)~
@934  = ~(You decide that you don't care.)~
@935  = ~(Brandock shuffles slightly in his sleep, but his breathing remains deep and steady.)~
@936  = ~(Brandock sleeps on, unaware of his surroundings.)~
@937  = ~(Brandock gets up when you are already awake. You notice him pause for a short moment, then he shuffles through his bag hectically. Obviously finding what he was looking for, he exhales audibly, before pausing one more time.)~ [c#ablank]
@938  = ~Er... <CHARNAME>? I don't remember putting the book into my backpack yesterday evening. Do you know who saved me...?~
@939  = ~(Smile) It was me this time.~
@940  = ~You really should have learned something last time this happened, I would think.~
@941  = ~You mean you don't remember the five mugs of ale, either?~
@942  = ~Oh no, I'm not falling for that. I don't remember drinking any... (He pauses.) I mean, I would not *do* that. I think.~
@943  = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. Thank you - thank you *so* much. I owe you. Maybe not my life, but my sanity, my credibility as a mage - as much as there still is of it - and my peacefulness against smaller mammals.~
@944  = ~(Brandock awakes after you. He blinks a few times, then jumps up halfway, nearly dropping the book. He manages to catch it before it falls down, making several hectic movements of questionable acrobatics.)~ [c#ablank]
@945  = ~By the mercy of... GODS... The nine hells! I... I fell asleep with a book on my lab. Again. Oh the mercy of the gods. And it is still here. It is still here...~
@946  = ~(He stows the book away, with what seems to be slightly trembling hands.)~
@947  = ~Hello there! Could I interest you in anything I caught today?~
@948  = ~Yes, please show us your wares.~
@949  = ~No, thank you.~
@950  = ~Have a good day then.~

@1050 = ~Gatewarden, would you have a look at the book remains my friend carries. It was a very valuable book, and a lot of it is readable still. Would this suffice to get entrance?~
@1051 = ~Gatewarden, would you have a look at the book my friend carries. It is a magic book of great historical value. Would this suffice to get entrance?~
@1052 = ~P... please, <CHARNAME>... don't...~
@1053 = ~What snippets and pieces are you offering? No, this will not do as the entry fee! If you have nothing else to offer, I need you to leave.~
@1054 = ~<CHARNAME>, why did you do that? I know they will learn eventually, but... but... Fine, so I wasn't banned directly. But that was only because the Gatewarden does not know the true value of this book!~
@1055 = ~Well, I guess it was worth a try.~
@1056 = ~What are you offering me as an entrance gift, a book consisting of empty pages? No, this will not do as the entry fee! If you have nothing else to offer, I need you to leave.~
@1057 = ~<CHARNAME>, next you try to give away my book, please ask me beforehand? Well, I guess it was worth a try.~
@1058 = ~C... Candlekeep? You are sending us to Candlekeep? You are sending us *into* Candlekeep? With a book valuable enough for the Gatewarden?~
@1059 = ~That's what I said, young man.~
@1060 = ~Oh - my - ... (Brandock stopps talking and just stands there, looking at the towers of Candlekeep, mouth open.)~ [c#ablank]
@1061 = ~You've never actually seen it, have you?~
@1062 = ~I agree it's quite impressive, now that I look at it from here.~
@1063 = ~You alright?~
@1064 = ~Great. If the walls from here already freeze your brain, then I don't want to know how we'll manage to actually approach the doors.~
@1065 = ~No, never.~
@1066 = ~It *is*, isn't it?~
@1067 = ~Oh yes, yes, I am alright.~
@1068 = ~Whut? Oh, yes, you are right.~
@1069 = ~Isn't it *marvellous*? This is by far the most impressive monastery I've ever seen. Well, what am I saying. It's Candlekeep!~
@1070 = ~You know I'm from Candlekeep, right? But I had to leave with Gorion, and now he's gone...~
@1071 = ~Let's move on.~
@1072 = ~Gods, <CHARNAME>, and here I am, gaping at Candlekeep's towers in the distance, while you lost your father, your home... I am sorry for your loss!~
@1073 = ~I am glad I can be of service. I really mean it.~
@1074 = ~Are we going there?~
@1075 = ~Do you... do you think they'll open the doors for you again?~
@1076 = ~You're... you're not planning on showing the book remains, are you?...~
@1077 = ~Well... (sigh) The doors will remain closed to us, I am sure of that. At least in the near future...~
@1078 = ~And we are going there. To say I'm nervous is, well... a huge understatement.~
@1079 = ~Ah, I wished we'd found the time to go and see Master Elvenhair. I would feel *much* better knowing what awaits me once someone finds out about what happened to the De Simplex Magicae.~
@1080 = ~Promise me not to talk to *anyone* about the destroyed De Simplex Magicae, <CHARNAME>... Please!...~
@1081 = ~We are going to Candlekeep! We are going *into* Candlekeep!~ [c#ablank]
@1082 = ~Yes, we are, my friend!~
@1083 = ~So it seems.~
@1084 = ~We are going there on an official investigation, Brandock.~
@1085 = ~Brandock, I need you as a mage in this group. Promise you will not turn into a knowledge seeking zombie in there.~
@1086 = ~I... I promise, <CHARNAME>. Although I beg you, don't be too cruel on me once we are inside and I'll turn into an excited adolescent.~
@1087 = ~Of... of course. Although spending a *little* bit of time there would be alright, no? Like... one afternoon. A few hours. *One* hour!~
@1088 = ~Brandock, this is your chance. This book will give us entry, you have the needed seal and a gift to stay as a seeker.~
@1089 = ~(smiles) I am sure we could arrange for an extra hour or two while we investigate the place.~
@1090 = ~We'll see, Brandock.~
@1091 = ~Just like that...~
@1092 = ~That would be fabulous!~
@1093 = ~<CHARNAME>, I have to ask... You know this is all I wanted and worked towards for months. When we will go inside, I need to know what my chances of staying are. I promised I'd support you and I will do so without any regret. But just in case - you know, that you might see a possibility to part with me so I could stay and at least decipher the pages in Ruathlek, I need to know now.~
@1094 = ~You really mean it? But what about your quest, what about my promise to support you? Candlekeep will stay right here and go nowhere... I guess.~
@1095 = ~Who knows what will happen. You have what you want now, so hold on to it and stay.~
@1096 = ~It's your decision, Brandock. I will not stand in your way.~
@1097 = ~Sure, I'd have a use for a good mage in my group, but it's not that there won't be other possibilities.~
@1098 = ~On second thought, I'd rather you would restrain yourself and stay with me.~
@1099 = ~Oh, this is a most unsettling decision to make... Assuming I fulfill the criteria for a seeker, and am not daydreaming again.~
@1100 = ~A tenday, <CHARNAME>. That is the timespan visitors can stay before thay have to leave at least for another month. A tenday should be enough to decipher what is written on the pages in Ruathlek. Then I will come back to you. I promise.~
@1101 = ~Why only a tenday? Master Elvenhair made it quite clear that you will be able to stay as an acrolyte to the monastery's wisdom.~
@1102 = ~A tenday sounds like a great compromise. You will get a good idea what to expect when you'll return in the future, and I'll have my mage back soon.~
@1103 = ~But... I would abandon you and your search, <CHARNAME>... the Sword Coast, even! My home land, Amn, in the uprising war! And all that just to study a book...~
@1104 = ~(moans) The gods really think this is funny, don't they? I'd have all I wanted, right here... but can't grab it without feeling bad!~
@1105 = ~I don't think it makes a difference whether you stay a tenday or for a year. I will take care of the uprising war, and I have the feeling it might be sorted soon already.~
@1106 = ~You'll have to decide for yourself, Brandock.~
@1107 = ~If you want to help with that then your stay in Candlekeep has to wait, I fear.~
@1108 = ~A good mage? Sure, I'll let you know when we meet one! (snort) Sorry, that wasn't even funny.~
@1109 = ~Then it is decided. I will stick with you inside Candlekeep until we will finish your investigations of the Iron Throne leaders, and then I'll stay for another tenday, digging through Ruathlek decipher tables!~
@1110 = ~Oh, I'm so excited my palms are sweaty!~
@1111 = ~Hm... You know, that is my feeling, too. And I can't sit in a library, knowing about all this... Candlekeep will have to wait. I will stay with you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1112 = ~But arrrrgh I really hope some god is enjoying this, so there'd be at least someone having fun here.~
@1113 = ~Oh, yes, please! Show us our quarters for the next tenday!~
@1114 = ~I see you are eager to start your studies. Please follow me.~
@1115 = ~Might I ask a quick question about where the translation books for Ruathlek would be?~
@1116 = ~Ruathlek? Yes, we have a lot of books about the old rune language of illusionists. I could show you if you want.~
@1117 = ~That would be much appreciated! We have something else to finish first, but once I am free I'll come back to you!~
@1118 = ~You do that. I'll be around.~
@1119 = ~Ruathlek? Ah, the old rune language of illusionists. I'll be happy to show a fellow wisdom seeker to where they are located.~
@1120 = ~That... was as awkward as my aunts Elly and March. I feel with you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1121 = ~Hm? Now, run along and play with your friends, yes?~
@1122 = ~Wait, what? That was a doppelganger! A doppelganger! They seem to show up everywhere the Iron Throne has their hands on. We have to warn the monks!~ [c#ablank]
@1123 = ~There were doppelgangers in the monastery! Do you know that? It wasn't the first time they turned up in the presence of the Iron Throne!~
@1124 = ~These are serious accusations, but I'll heed your warning, young friend.~
@1125 = ~Doppelgangers! All those doppelgangers... What is going on here, <CHARNAME>?~ [c#ablank]
@1126 = ~This is not what I thought. In the library I thought it's just some of the Iron Throne's pets they brought with them for protection, but this...~
@1127 = ~This looked like preparations for an invasion!~
@1128 = ~(sigh) This would have been a great ending, <CHARNAME>. It all being an illusion, Elminster and Gorion, taking us out of the horrors into a world without Iron Throne, without doppelgangers, where you would be still in Candlekeep...~ [c#ablank]
@1129 = ~And me still mourning over my lost possessions. Or... would *I* have been part of the illusion and doomed to remain here?... I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. I am sorry there was no easy way out.~
@1130 = ~At least we have a name... and maybe a face? "Koveras" - Sarevok. But what would he *want* from you? And why this masquerade? Why this setup? I mean I understand very well that it was to get you out of the way, and that Koveras-Sarevok obviously works with whoever murdered Gorion - but *why*?~
@1131 = ~...Expelled.~ [c#ablank]
@1132 = ~Brandock, I am so sorry you were caught in this.~
@1133 = ~I am shocked myself, Brandock.~
@1134 = ~Not now, Brandock. I have other problems than to listen to your whiny self-pity!~
@1135 = ~Oh, but I am not sorry, <CHARNAME>.~
@1136 = ~Self-pity?~
@1137 = ~I am angry! I am totally, absolutely, completely angry!~
@1138 = ~Yes, I can imagine. To lose what you wanted for so long...~
@1139 = ~Why?~
@1140 = ~I don't care with which emotions you respond to being expelled from Candlekeep. I don't have time to listen to your woes!~
@1141 = ~What? No, that's not the reason I'm angry.~
@1142 = ~I am angry because they accused you, and me, of things we did not *do*!~
@1143 = ~Yes, we killed the Iron Throne leaders - but it's not that they gave us much choice!~
@1144 = ~Someone surely wanted to put the blame on us.~
@1145 = ~We need to find out what is going on and clear our name!~
@1146 = ~I am furious, too. There is nothing we can do right now than find our way out of here.~
@1147 = ~That's not the reaction I expected from you.~
@1148 = ~Let's just find our way out of here, Brandock. I don't feel like talking.~
@1149 = ~Sure!~
@1150 = ~I am... glad I am here now, and not back up there. To stay, knowing you are accusted of murder, not knowing what really happened, believeing you to be executed the following day! I would be grief-stricken!~
@1151 = ~Also, to be honest - the situation as it was back there with all the people and *Doppelgangers* bustling around, I don't think I'd have found much quietness for studying, anyway.~
@1152 = ~Also, to be honest - the situation as it was back there with all the people and bustling around and Iron Throne meetings in the inner keep, I don't think I'd have found much quietness for studying, anyway.~
@1153 = ~We will clear our names, and I will return here later - sometime in the future, when no Iron Throne leaders have meetings in these halls of wisdom and no war is hanging over the lands.~
@1154 = ~Wanted for murder! Because some... some someone gives a false testimony. And Ulraunt just... just sentences us to death. You know what? He is just like the Cowled Wizards I wanted to circumvent! Ah, this does hit me as a shock, I have to admit...~
@1155 = ~I should have been warned, <CHARNAME>, after what you told me from this place and how they treated you after Gorion's death.~
@1156 = ~Candlekeep infiltrated by doppelgangers. I am so shocked I don't know what to say.~
@1157 = ~So many doppelgangers... and all pretending to be someone else. Someone you knew... It is said that doppelgangers personificate after they killed. This would mean, that all the persons they personified...~ [c#ablank]
@1158 = ~But no, there was also a personification of Gorion! We know he wasn't killed by doppelgangers... er, we do know that, yes?~
@1159 = ~Yes, I am pretty sure Elminster wasn't killed by the doppelganger we met down there.~
@1160 = ~I surely hope it doesn't mean that not everyone we "saw" is dead.~
@1161 = ~This is a nightmare.~
@1162 = ~Was there anything we could have done?~
@1163 = ~I don't want to talk about this.~
@1164 = ~Indeed.~
@1165 = ~Well, we can't save the ones they already killed. And we walked the catacombs, there were no more living people, or we would have found them! But we killed all doppelgangers down in the catacombs. What about the people in the keep? Shouldn't we *warn* someone?~
@1166 = ~You warned Tethtoril. I am sure they will look out for more of them.~
@1167 = ~We met Arkanis and Deder - they know! I am sure they will be warning the others.~
@1168 = ~Hm, after we went through the catacombs I don't have the impression there is much left that needs a warning against.~
@1169 = ~This is not my problem any more.~
@1170 = ~Well, we did our best to stop them, even though we didn't know we are fighting a doppelganger invasion when we started. But to have to just walk away leaves me uneasy...~
@1171 = ~This is a very good thought, Brandock, and an important matter. I will give note to my brethren at next occasion. The Order of the Radiant Heart will know about the ongoings in Candlekeep and see to the dopplegangers being defeated!~
@1172 = ~Well, make sure they'll have a valuable book with them if they try to get passage... (moans) Forgive me, that remark was tasteless. I thank you, Ajantis. This is very reassuring, and should be enough to resolve the matter.~
@1173 = ~(sigh) To know that Candlekeep was about to be infiltrated by doppelgangers! The mighty library... I need to ponder this, <CHARNAME>. And what this must mean to you, I can only guess!~
@1174 = ~But it was your home! Your remark gives me shivers down the spine, <CHARNAME>.~
@1175 = ~<CHARNAME>, how do you feel? I know there is much on your plate, currently. What I am referring to is what we experienced in Candlekeep. Your home, and not only did you have to leave it a wanted criminal, but saw it being invaded by doppelgangers... Your childhood friends, a lot of those people you knew - dead. Is there anything I can do for you?~ [c#ablank]
@1176 = ~I try to manage, Brandock. Thank you for caring.~
@1177 = ~Yes, just be here and be a friend. It helps a lot, already.~
@1178 = ~No, I am afraid not. This is something I'll have to deal with, and nothing will make it better.~
@1179 = ~I need to go back there, once this is all over, and see who is still alive. There were too many deaths, for sure.~
@1180 = ~Brandock, all I care about currently is that I am a child of Bhaal. I need to understand this before talking about anything else.~
@1181 = ~Just shut up.~
@1182 = ~Of course. Sorry.~
@1183 = ~I know that we all have to carry our plate full but yours is really stacking at the moment.~
@1184 = ~I'll come with you, if I'll be at your side still.~
@1185 = ~Let's go and find that evil overlord behind all this.~
@1186 = ~I am sorry to bring this up again, <CHARNAME>, but I am still thinking about the doppelganger invasion in Candlekeep... You know, in a different life, I would have been one of the persons being killed and replaced, down in the catacombs.~ [c#ablank]
@1187 = ~That might have happened, yes.~
@1188 = ~I am very glad it didn't happen that way, Brandock. I like having you at my side.~
@1189 = ~What a thought... But as you said, 'in another life'. What happened, happened.~
@1190 = ~Not necessarily.~
@1191 = ~Hm, you mean the foxes did you a favor?~
@1192 = ~Nope, still don't want to talk about this.~
@1193 = ~It's hypothetical, of course, but seeing all those doppelgangers and knowing of all the infiltrations they've already done, I really don't think I'd have had a chance.~
@1194 = ~I'm very glad, too. Oh, and I also like being at your side, <CHARNAME>, thank you for the kind words.~
@1195 = ~I *was* pondering about that.~
@1196 = ~Maybe it is wishful thinking born out of what happened with that book which still haunts me, and rightfully so. But still, I can't get rid of the thought that it might indeed be a favor the foxes did me. Who knows...~
@1197 = ~This is the absolute first time that I have something like a feeling of thankfulness towards the gods who prevented my going to Candlekeep. If the foxes wouldn't have taken my book...~
@1198 = ~And again, the gods showed quite the humor while shaping a man's destiny. I am referring to the foxes. Not the dead in Candlekeep. Definitely not the dead in Candlekeep...~
@1199 = ~Understood. I wanted to phrase my praise to the gods, out of a very egoistic reason, while criticizing their means, but I guess we can skip this, if you are not in the mood.~

/* brandock_shapeshifter.d */
@1250 = ~You would be a mage? Stuck in form of a chicken! Because a spell went wrong?! - What a nightmare...~
@1251 = ~<CHARNAME>, I think I know a way to help this poor chicken. I mean man! In my possessions, there is a book with knowledge that might be of help, and I would like to have it, just in case. Please, let us collect my possessions now. The cave is just south east from where we first met, I marked it on your map.~
@1252 = ~So, Melicamp... Master Thalantyr would be your master? *The* master Thalantyr?~ [c#ablank]
@1253 = ~Erm ... haha, would there be *cluck* another one?~
@1254 = ~Of course not. A misread incantation, you said it was? What kind of incantation?~
@1255 = ~Erm ... it was a, er, polymorphing one.~
@1256 = ~That fits. I didn't speak up until now, because, frankly, I don't think that my level of expertise will be of much help here... Although, we do have all needed ingredients, and as long as noone would interfere, the spell I have in mind might actually work. But as I said, it's way above my level of expertise and I...~
@1257 = ~Oh, it's a great idea to try, my friend. Anything that spares me, er, I mean Master Thalantyr the hassle *cluck* of having to deal with, er, this, yes?~
@1258 = ~I sense your fear to face your master in this state. <CHARNAME>, I could try and help this poor man. Casting the spell would be not the problem, it's the lack of experience I am worried about. What do you say?~
@1259 = ~That's a good notion. If you think you have a cure, then try.~
@1260 = ~Why would casting a spell "way above your level of expertise" be no problem?~
@1261 = ~I'm not sure this is such a good idea.~
@1262 = ~I'd rather we leave this to Thalantyr, instead of tinkering with magic above your level.~
@1263 = ~No. This might lead to unwanted side effects, so I forbid it.~
@1264 = ~Of course it's not a good idea! It's mine, after all. Question is, whether that's a reason not to try.~
@1265 = ~I know the spell out of a book I studied... very intensely. The book deals with very complicated magic and how to do complicated magic if you are lesser skilled. It is a book for learning as well as... enabling magic, so to speak. I'd rather have the book with me, but I do know the spell by heart.~
@1266 = ~Alright, then do it.~
@1267 = ~I know the spell out of my destroyed book which I studied... very intensely. The thing about it is that it was not that valuable because it deals with very complicated magic, but that it explained how to do complicated magic for the lesser skilled. It was a book for learning as well as... enabling magic, so to speak.~
@1268 = ~I understand. I guess it's better that way.~
@1269 = ~(exhales) Alright, here we go. Everyone, stand back! Stuck in the form of a chicken! That's unbearable...~
@1270 = ~A half-ogre! Where did ...~
@1271 = ~Bright ... bright light ...~ [c#ablank]
@1272 = ~What ... Help ... I am not ... Not ...~
@1273 = ~Me Brandock! <CHARNAME>, help! Need help ...~
@1274 = ~Er, that didn't work as planned... did it? Brandock? Brandock? *cluck* Oh dear, I guess master Thalantyr will *cluck* will have to help us ...~
@1275 = ~Thalantyr! Yes, yes! Great mage, can help!~
@1276 = ~Come, half-ogre! Brandock needs body back! We go to great mage Thalantyr!~
@1277 = ~Oh dear... (Chicken Melicamp nestles himself back into your backpack.)~

@1280 = ~Me hungry ...~ [c#ablank]
@1281 = ~I see my comrade Brandock and this half-ogre made their way here...~
@1282 = ~Ah, but of course I didn't forget your friend here. (sigh) Well, then let's try our luck once more, shall we?~
@1283 = ~Ah, yes, you look like the friend this unfortunate man tried to describe. I am on it, but I didn't really figure out what the problem was, yet. There is only few magic spells or items able to induce such an outcome, if it is not wild magic we are talking about.~
@1284 = ~I'd need to know the source of this magic. Until then, I need to stabilize your friend here or he'll collapse.~
@1285 = ~... Ah, so this chicken Melicamp is the source of the polymorphing spell your unfortunate friend tried to reverse? This is good, and bad. Good, because now I know what to try. Bad, because it is dangerous magic we are dealing with. (sigh) Go and get that skull. It will be far more effective than I realized, helping three creatures at once.~
@1286 = ~And your friend's mind will eventually fade to nothingness. No mind is made to be in another creature's body without being able to go back.~
@1287 = ~Well, what can I say. This worked as planned.~ [c#ablank]
@1288 = ~This is me! This is ... me, yes, all the way down and ... I *think* also on my back. Feet - check, hands - check, my brain works as it is supposed to, and I can *talk* normally. This being something people will regret in time, probably, but ...~
@1289 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>, thank you!~
@1290 = ~And mostly thank you, Master Thalantyr, of course. Without your knowledge and prowess, I would have lost myself in 250 kilograms of green skin. You are the greatest, and best acknowledges wizard I ever met. Grumpy, but also very kind, as you just showed twice.~
@1291 = ~Now, am I not happy to be able to help young fools roam the lands some more.~
@1292 = ~But I have to ask, although I know I will regret it. Why in the nine hells did you try to polymorph that fool if you can't handle the magic involved?!~
@1293 = ~Erm, I read about it... about something like this. It might have worked, were not the half-ogre been there...~
@1294 = ~Where would you read about something like this? There is only one book that would come to my mind. And that's Bowgentle's Book! Or what is said to be its predecessessor, the De Simplex -~
@1295 = ~...Magicae, yes... Erm, that's the book I am referring to. I had time to study it for a while in, er... the great library of Alisarhold...~
@1296 = ~Indeed! So it found a way back into civilization after being lost for so long. And you would have studied it? Interesting. One word of advice, young man. Best you try to keep that knowledge of yours inside your head until you are capable of handling it. Understand? Best you get out now. All of you.~
@1297 = ~All... so bright ...~

@1300 = ~Brandock making a fool out of himself, for the umptieth time! Just... just when I thought it couldn't get any worse.~ [c#ablank]
@1301 = ~I am sorry, <CHARNAME>, for what happened. It was the right spell... for what I had in mind. But not for the exact circumstances and I shouldn't have cast it. I cannot thank you enough for your help. That was... quite an experience. One I'd like to forget, and desparately.~
@1302 = ~Really?... But as what? I can't carry heavy things and I'm not a good fighter. I can cook, though - although maybe I should stay away from *anything* that includes a recipe and...~
@1303 = ~Stop babbling, Brandock. I want you as a mage.~
@1304 = ~How about you do what you do best: magic.~
@1305 = ~Brandock, you want to get experience and learn to master magic. Come with me, fight with me, and you might become what you wish.~
@1306 = ~With that attitude, I don't think I'll have a use for you.~
@1307 = ~You mean 'learning by doing'? Hm. According to my first teacher, I wasn't so bad at that, once. Hey, I even have experience with wild magic! Ha. Ha. Ha. But it's a thought, really.~
@1308 = ~I thank you for your trust, <CHARNAME>. Right now, I do not think I am a good mage. I'm not even sure I should call myself a *mage*... But practice could change that, of course... If I'll stay away from anything not my level of expertise.~
@1309 = ~I know I have no other option left than becoming a great, well-known mage by being one of the heroes of the road. An adventurer, trained in fighting in the heat of the battle. Maybe even save a village or two? This ... this would indeed put me into a position with great potential. And I'd have a lot of practice on the way, oh yes.~
@1310 = ~I am ready, <CHARNAME>, and I know I want to travel with you, and not only because I have no other choice. I am ready for having long, exhausting, tiring days on the road, fighting, instead of... probably long, exhausting, tiring, *and* frustrating days working indoors.~
@1311 = ~Question is: are *you* ready to spend the rest of your quest with me?... But who says you have to decide that now. Let's just see how today will go. And tomorrow. And the day after that...~
@1312 = ~I am ready.~
@1313 = ~That's how we will do it.~
@1314 = ~Are you always talking that much if you have to make a decision? I need a mage, not a jawsmith!~
@1315 = ~On second thought, forget it. I don't think I'd have a use for you.~
@1316 = ~I guess by now I have proven not to be of any use as a mage on the road. We have combined forces for a while but you are probably already regretting it. I will go and find my own way from here, if... if you wish.~
@1317 = ~No, Brandock. I want you to come with me.~
@1318 = ~Maybe it is good that book is destroyed, you know. Seeing what can happen if its spells are cast by the lesser experienced. So, at least some good can be concluded by all of what happened.~
@1319 = ~Brandock, you tend to be a bit over-ambituous, that is all. Mistakes happen to all of us.~
@1320 = ~No way you'll just leave now. I need a mage in this group so you'll stay until I'll find a suitable replacement.~
@1321 = ~Yes, please go. Fare well, Brandock.~
@1322 = ~You... you mean you do not send me away?~
@1323 = ~Oh, but you can't make the book responsible if one of its spells is cast in the inproper moment incuding wild magic... which is exactly what you said. (sigh) So, you want me to leave?~
@1324 = ~I... I understand.~
@1325 = ~No, not always. Usually, I restrict myself to making sensless, wanna-be funny, but *short* remarks. I only tend to babble if I realize I'll have to re-order my whole life plan for the coming years... Which should not happen again soon, seeing how I destroyed any other possibility already.~
@1326 = ~No? Thank the gods! No, it's a pity, actually. (sigh) Thank you again for your help. Please don't tell me you did it to free the half-ogre...~
@1327 = ~Alright, I'll be in the Jovial Juggler, in case you change your mind. Pondering my ... possibilities.~
@1328 = ~<CHARNAME>, I would be very, very happy to be a member of your group. It's not that I am completely oblivious to adventuring. Coming as far as the Sword Coast on my own was a tale worth telling, I have to say. Or, better not for telling anyone, I suppose.~
@1329 = ~Yes, I would like to continue to travel with you, if you'd allow me.~
@1330 = ~Welcome aboard, then.~
@1331 = ~Only under the condition that you do not talk that much on usual occasions.~
@1332 = ~I won't. You'll be surprised how dull travelling with me can be.~
@1333 = ~Great! Then let's go. And <CHARNAME>: unless you start kidnapping grannies or torturing puppies, I'll be on your side with no further interruptions. You have my word for that.~

@1500 = ~What kind of madness was that? I will have a look at this mage's spellbook, so at least *something* good comes out of this... this needless slaughter.~ [c#ablank]
@1501 = ~Could I have a look at that book? Oh... oh, yes. This is... nothing I will make use of myself, thank you very much.~ [c#ablank]
@1502 = ~Could I have a look at Dradeel's spell book? Hm... No, I do not think I have an idea how to read this. It would make an interesting object for study, though. Er, I did not intend to suggest that this would be a valid reason to keep it from the poor man. It's not *that* interesting.~ [c#ablank]
@1503 = ~To be attacked out of the blue... I should be used to it by now, shouldn't I? Let me have a look into those mages' spellbooks. They were quite powerful...~ [c#ablank]
@1504 = ~Look at all this wisdom! Wich ... I am ... not here to cherish. <CHARNAME>, let's get on with what we have to do, before I forget my vow to support you no matter what.~ [c#ablank]
@1505 = ~It's not like we wouldn't have any time at all. Have a stroll around, if you like. I'll wait.~
@1506 = ~We are here on a mission. Let's keep going.~
@1507 = ~Look at all this wisdom! Oh, oh, I can't wait to get my hands on the books! <CHARNAME>, let's get on with what we have to do, before I forget my promise to remain at your side until the investigation is done.~ [c#ablank]
@1508 = ~You'll have enough time when we are done, Brandock. For now, let's focus on why we are here.~
@1509 = ~Of course.~
@1510 = ~Oh-oh, really? Just a quick look what kind of books there actually *are* - so I'll know what to look forward to!~
@1511 = ~Oh-oh, really? Just a quick look what kind of books there actually *are* - so I'll know what I'll be missing...~
@1512 = ~Young man, if you lean any closer to the table you might drool onto my newly acquired books, which I would find most unfortunate.~
@1513 = ~I'm... I'm so sorry, Master Elvenhair. I...~
@1514 = ~I see you have a curious mind, and a good heart, my friend. Feel free to stay and look through the books and tomes you see here. They are for others to appreciate the contained wisdom - but you'll have to do so now, because I will send them on their way to Candlekeep soon.~
@1515 = ~You are very generous, Master Elvenhair.~
@1516 = ~I... I probably shouldn't. Not after... But...~
@1517 = ~I... would like to do so right away! Could we spare the moment, <CHARNAME>... Please?~
@1518 = ~Fine, I'll wait.~
@1519 = ~No, we don't have the time.~
@1520 = ~Thank you! This won't take a minute... More like several hours... Gnah, I will be quick.~
@1521 = ~Ooh, this is most unfortunate... But I'll restrain myself then.~
@1522 = ~To lose one's mind so - in what one believes to be love, while hurting the object of desire... Well, Master Ragefast surely had a clear mind when collecting his library. And look at the size of that telescope!~ [c#ablank]
@1523 = ~Master Ragefast, may I have a look at your precious collection of magic books? I see a lot of names I only have seen in well-known libraries before...~
@1524 = ~Hm? Yes, yes, do that, my interested young friend. I have no mood for studying books in my current state...~
@1525 = ~<CHARNAME>, could we spare a minute? I see a lot of names I only have seen in well-known libraries before...~
@1526 = ~Alright, Brandock. I'll wait for a moment.~
@1527 = ~We've been in here long enough. Let's go.~
@1528 = ~Thank you!~
@1529 = ~Books! So many books! Many, many wizard books!...~ [c#ablank]
@1530 = ~Yes, have a look around, Brandock.~
@1531 = ~Brandock, I want to get out of here as fast as possible. Let's go.~
@1532 = ~Oh, books! Dwarven books! *Old* dwarven books! <CHARNAME>, I *have* to have a look at these. Please!~ [c#ablank]
@1533 = ~It's alright, I think. We can have a small rest here while we wait.~
@1534 = ~Brandock, I need you to be on alert. This is dangerous ground.~
@1535 = ~Thank you! I'll try to be quick.~
@1536 = ~I'm not sure I like the fact how we retrieved it, but this is definitely a very interesting book. I don't think I'll be able to build a skyship, but reading about it is most interesting.~

/* c#brando_bg1end_bgt.d */
@2000 = ~<CHARNAME>, I think this is a good time to say good bye. We both reached our goals. Sarevok is stopped, and I learned a lot about wielding magic... Please understand that I need to take my way back to Amn on my own. I cannot return as a representative of Baldur's Gate authorities - I am sure you understand.~
@2001 = ~Take care, <CHARNAME>. Seeing how your path guides you to Amn, I am sure we will meet there? Who knows, maybe I'll have an influencial position when next we meet - it's always good to have friends, if you are in Amn. Take care down there, will you?~
