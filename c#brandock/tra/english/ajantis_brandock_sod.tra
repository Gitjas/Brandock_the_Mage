@0    = ~[Brandock]I am happy to be back travelling with <CHARNAME>, but I'd never thought it would be the case. I meant farewell when we parted. Not that I am complaining, not at all.~
@1    = ~[Ajantis]I didn't expect to be back so soon, either.~
@2    = ~[Ajantis]I am also not complaining to be back at my beloved's side.~
@3    = ~[Brandock]You were ordered back here. I kind of... dawdled away time in the neighborhood because I couldn't make myself to go back to Amn to face the Cowled Wizards.~
@4    = ~[Ajantis]I am anticipating my return to Amn, to be standing in front of the knights of the Order of the Radiant Heart to be judged of my worthiness to become a full fledged member. It is what I was working for ever since I came to the Sword Coast.~
@5    = ~[Brandock]Yes, I also came here with the goal of becoming a well-versed mage. And yet our motivations are so different. It was your duty that let you return. For me, being here now is more the result of... decision paralysis, I guess. While it urges me to go home, at the same time I'm dreading it. Dreading it so much that I rather joined <CHARNAME> in the pursuit of a crusade so far up in the north that its impact wouldn't even be noticeable down in the south.~
@6    = ~[Ajantis]You think you are not ready to return?~
@7    = ~[Brandock]I don't know - I am much more experienced now than when I met <CHARNAME> back at Lion's Way - but how to judge whether I'm strong enough to return on my own terms? I will return once I'll find myself wasting time again. Or before I'll start the next life threatening adventure to avoid it...~
