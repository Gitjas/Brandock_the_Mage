@0  = ~[Brandock]I am *really* happy Thalantyr is as wise as he is - shrinking those bracers so they do not fit, that's a really smart idea. Those things still make me nervous as hell. If it was up to me, I'd get them to Taerom fast.~ [c#ablank]
@1  = ~[Brandock]I might have an idea about gems that are best suited for scrying devices. I studied stuff like this for years while working for a Cowled Wizard. Some are obvious, because they are expensive anyway. But there is some that do not strike as overly valuable, which doesn't mean they aren't well suited for the task. Ask me if you want me to give suggestions.~
