@0    = ~Brage... To kill one's family while under such an evil influence. What a thought. What a horrible, awful, *terrifying* thought. I... I am truly sorry for your loss.~ [c#ablank]
@1    = ~I thank you, Brandock.~
@2    = ~I wonder if the righteous, the friendly, the steadfast, fall prey to such magic more easily? Is the effect of corruption stronger for the murderous ones? Imagine an evil blackguard, full of lust for the slaughter taking up such a weapon. Would anyone even *notice*?~
@3    = ~I hope you don't see this as a laughing matter. Although... the thought had crossed my mind. It would be self-righteous of me to look for an explanation. I made a mistake... a lot of mistakes.~
@4    = ~I'm sorry, Brage. I'm just shocked by what happened. I keep on going over it in my mind which seems to produce these thoughts... to distract me from the horrors.~
