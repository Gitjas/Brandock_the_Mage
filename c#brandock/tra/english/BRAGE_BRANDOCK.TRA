@0    = ~Brage... To kill ones own family while under such an evil influence. What a thought. What a horrible, awful, *terrorising* thought. I... I am truly sorry for your loss.~ [c#ablank]
@1    = ~I thank you, Brandock.~
@2    = ~I wonder if the righteousness, the fiendly, the steadfast, if they are easier prey to such magic. If led to corruption, is the effect stronger than for the evil, murdering ones? ... I mean, imagine an evil blackguard, full of lust for slaughter and murder taking up such a weapon. Would anyone *notice*?~
@3    = ~I hope you don't see this as a joking matter? Although, it's... a thought that crossed my mind, too. But it would be self-righteous to look for explanations like these. I did a mistake... a did a lot of mistakes.~
@4    = ~I am sorry, Brage. I am shocked about what happened, and it keeps turning in my head. This is when my mind starts producing such thoughts... trying to distract me from the horrors it rises.~
