# Brandock the Mage
NPC Mod for Baldur's Gate

Brandock the Mage is an NPC Mod for the whole Baldur's Gate Epic. It is natively compatible with BG:EE, SoD, BGII, BGT, BGII:EE, EET. No Tutu.

In BG1 Brandock can be met at the Coast Way where he is looking for help to fight an Ogre to retrieve his possessions back. Depending on whether he is in party when Melicamp is brought to Thalantyr he will have an extra quest that will remove him from the party for a time.
Brandock is very interested in magic books. Every time he gets time to study magic books the group encounters in the game it will increase his lore score. He is friendly and helpful, but it will take a little time until he opens up and tells the PC where he originates from, for reasons he will readily explain once he is ready to.

So far, only the BG1 content of the mod is finished.
